<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> a memorial of work done on behalf of the rights
of animals, it has been thought fitting, by members
and friends of the late Humanitarian League, that a
new edition of this little book should be published in
the year that brings the centenary of &#8220;Martin&#8217;s Act,&#8221;
the first legislation for the prevention of cruelty to
the non-human races.</p>

<p>Of the progress made in this branch of ethics, since
1822, some account is incidentally given in the book;
and during the last few years the advance has been
steadily continued. Attention has been drawn, for
instance, to the antiquated methods employed in the
slaughter of animals for food; and this has corresponded
with an increase in the practice of vegetarianism.
The treatment of other domestic animals, such
as pit ponies, and the worn-out horses exported to
the Continent, has stirred the public conscience; and
at the same time the cruelty and folly of what is
technically known as &#8220;the wild animal industry&#8221;&mdash;the
kidnapping of &#8220;specimens&#8221; for exhibition in zoological
gardens, or as &#8220;performing animals&#8221; on the stage&mdash;are
becoming better understood.</p>

<p>Again, the disgust caused by the ravages of
&#8220;murderous millinery&#8221; (a term first used as a chapter-heading
in this book) has taken visible shape in the
recent Act for the regulation of the plumage trade;
and even &#8220;sport,&#8221; the last and dearest stronghold of
the savage, has been seriously menaced, not only by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
the discontinuance of the Royal Buckhounds in 1901,
but also lately by the emphatic condemnation of
pigeon-shooting.</p>

<p>The core of the contention for a recognition of the
rights of animals will be found in the following passage
of a letter addressed by Mr. Thomas Hardy to the
Humanitarian League in 1910:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Few people seem to perceive fully as yet that the most
far-reaching consequence of the establishment of the common
origin of all species is ethical; that it logically involved a
readjustment of altruistic morals, by enlarging, as a necessity
of rightness, the application of what has been called &#8216;The
Golden Rule&#8217; from the area of mere mankind to that of the
whole animal kingdom.... While man was deemed to be
a creation apart from all other creations, a secondary or
tertiary morality was considered good enough to practise
towards the &#8216;inferior&#8217; races; but no person who reasons
nowadays can escape the trying conclusion that this is not
maintainable.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>It may be taken, perhaps, as a sign of the extension
of humane ideas that, since its first appearance in 1892,
this essay on &#8220;Animals&#8217; Rights&#8221; has passed through
numerous editions, and has been translated into
French, German, Dutch, Swedish, and other European
tongues.</p>

<p>Valuable suggestions concerning the book have
reached me from several friends: in particular I am
indebted to Sir George Greenwood, who has been
actively associated, both in Parliament and elsewhere,
with the cause of justice to animals.</p>

<small>THE PRINCIPLE OF ANIMALS&#8217; RIGHTS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Have</span> the lower animals &#8220;rights&#8221;? Undoubtedly&mdash;if
men have. That is the point I wish to make evident
in this opening chapter. But have men rights? Let
it be stated at the outset that I have no intention of
discussing the abstract theory of rights, which at the
present time is looked upon with suspicion and disfavour
by many social reformers, since it has not unfrequently
been made to cover the most extravagant
and contradictory assertions. But though its phraseology
is vague, there is nevertheless a solid truth underlying
it&mdash;a truth which has always been clearly
apprehended by the moral faculty, however difficult
it may be to establish it on an unassailable logical
basis. If men have not &#8220;rights&#8221;&mdash;well, they have an
unmistakable intimation of something very similar; a
sense of justice which marks the boundary-line where
acquiescence ceases and resistance begins; a demand
for freedom to live their own lives, subject to the
necessity of respecting the equal freedom of other
people.</p>

<p>Such is the doctrine of rights as formulated by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
Herbert Spencer. &#8220;Every man,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is free to
do that which he wills, provided he infringes not the
equal liberty of any other man.&#8221; And again, &#8220;Whoever
admits that each man must have a certain restricted
freedom, asserts that it is <i>right</i> he should have
this restricted freedom.... And hence the several
particular freedoms deducible may fitly be called, as
they commonly are called, his <i>rights</i>&#8221; (&#8220;Justice,&#8221;
pp. 46, 62).<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The fitness of this nomenclature is disputed, but
the existence of some real principle of the kind can
hardly be called in question; so that the controversy
concerning &#8220;rights&#8221; is little else than an academic
battle over words, which leads to no practical conclusion.
I shall assume, therefore, that men are
possessed of &#8220;rights,&#8221; in the sense of Herbert Spencer&#8217;s
definition; and if any of my readers object to
this qualified use of the term, I can only say that I
shall be perfectly willing to change the word as soon
as a more appropriate one is forthcoming.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The immediate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
question that claims our attention is this&mdash;if
men have rights, have animals their rights also?</p>



<p>From the earliest times there have been thinkers
who, directly or indirectly, answered this question
with an affirmative. The Buddhist and Pythagorean
canons, dominated perhaps by the creed of reincarnation,
included the maxim &#8220;not to kill or injure any
innocent animal.&#8221; The humanitarian philosophers of
the Roman empire, among whom Seneca, Plutarch,
and Porphyry were the most conspicuous, took still
higher ground in preaching humanity on the broadest
principle of universal benevolence. &#8220;Since justice is
due to rational beings,&#8221; wrote Porphyry, &#8220;how is it
possible to evade the admission that we are bound
also to act justly towards the races below us?&#8221;</p>

<p>It is a lamentable fact that during the churchdom
of the middle ages, from the fourth century to the
sixteenth, from the time of Porphyry to the time of
Montaigne, little or no attention was paid to the
question of the rights and wrongs of the lower races.
Then, with the Reformation and the revival of
learning, came a revival also of humanitarian feeling,
as may be seen in many passages of Erasmus and
More, Shakespeare and Bacon; but it was not until
the eighteenth century, the age of enlightenment and
&#8220;sensibility,&#8221; of which Voltaire and Rousseau were
the spokesmen, that the rights of animals obtained
more deliberate recognition. From the great Revolution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
of 1789 dates the period when the world-wide
spirit of humanitarianism, which had hitherto been
felt by but one man in a million&mdash;the thesis of the
philosopher or the vision of the poet&mdash;began to disclose
itself, gradually and dimly at first, as an essential
feature of democracy.</p>

<p>A great and far-reaching effect was produced in
England at this time by the publication of such
revolutionary works as Thomas Paine&#8217;s &#8220;Rights of Man&#8221;
and Mary Wollstonecraft&#8217;s &#8220;Vindication of the Rights
of Woman&#8221;; and looking back now, after the lapse
of a hundred years, we can see that a still wider
extension of the theory of rights was thenceforth
inevitable. In fact, such a claim was anticipated&mdash;if
only in bitter jest&mdash;by a contemporary writer, who
furnishes us with a notable instance of how the
mockery of one generation may become the reality of
the next. There was published anonymously in 1792
a little volume entitled &#8220;A Vindication of the Rights
of Brutes,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of Mary
Wollstonecraft&#8217;s essay, written, as the author informs us,
&#8220;to evince by demonstrative arguments the perfect
equality of what is called the irrational species to the
human.&#8221; The further opinion is expressed that &#8220;after
those wonderful productions of Mr. Paine and Mrs.
Wollstonecraft, such a theory as the present seems to
be necessary.&#8221; It <i>was</i> necessary; and a very short
term of years sufficed to bring it into effect; indeed,
the theory had already been put forward by several
English pioneers of nineteenth-century humanitarianism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>To Jeremy Bentham, in particular, belongs the high
honour of first asserting the rights of animals with
authority and persistence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The legislator,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;ought to interdict everything
which may serve to lead to cruelty. The barbarous
spectacles of gladiators no doubt contributed to give the
Romans that ferocity which they displayed in their civil
wars. A people accustomed to despise human life in their
games could not be expected to respect it amid the fury of
their passions. It is proper for the same reason to forbid
every kind of cruelty towards animals, whether by way of
amusement, or to gratify gluttony. Cock-fights, bull-baiting,
hunting hares and foxes, fishing, and other amusements of
the same kind, necessarily suppose either the absence of reflection
or a fund of inhumanity, since they produce the
most acute sufferings to sensible beings, and the most painful
and lingering death of which we can form any idea. Why
should the law refuse its protection to any sensitive being?
The time will come when humanity will extend its mantle
over everything which breathes. We have begun by attending
to the condition of slaves; we shall finish by softening
that of all the animals which assist our labours or supply
our wants.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></div>

<p>So, too, wrote one of Bentham&#8217;s contemporaries:
&#8220;The grand source of the unmerited and superfluous
misery of beasts exists in a defect in the constitution
of all communities. No human government, I
believe, has ever recognized the <i>jus animalium</i>, which
ought surely to form a part of the jurisprudence of
every system founded on the principles of justice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
and humanity.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> A number of later moralists have
followed on the same lines, with the result that the
rights of animals have already, to a certain limited
extent, been established both in private usage and by
legal enactment.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the exact commencement
of this new principle in law. When Lord Erskine,
speaking in the House of Lords in 1811, advocated
the cause of justice to the lower animals, he was
greeted with loud cries of insult and derision. But
eleven years later the efforts of the despised humanitarians,
and especially of Richard Martin, of Galway,
were rewarded by their first success. The passing of
the Ill-treatment of Cattle Bill, commonly known as
&#8220;Martin&#8217;s Act,&#8221; in July, 1822, is a memorable date in
the history of humane legislation, less on account of
the positive protection afforded by it, for it applied
only to cattle and &#8220;beasts of burden,&#8221; than for the
invaluable precedent which it created. From 1822
onward, the principle of that <i>jus animalium</i> for which
Bentham had pleaded, was recognized, however partially
and tentatively at first, by English law, and the
animals included in the Act ceased to be the mere
property of their owners; moreover the Act has been
several times supplemented and extended during the
past half century. It is scarcely possible, in the face
of this legislation, to maintain that &#8220;rights&#8221; are a
privilege with which none but human beings can be
invested; for if <i>some</i> animals are already included<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
within the pale of protection, why should not more
and more be so included in the future?<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>For the present, however, what is most urgently
needed is some comprehensive and intelligible principle,
which shall indicate, in a more consistent manner,
the true lines of man&#8217;s moral relation towards the
lower animals. Hitherto even the leading advocates
of animals&#8217; rights seem to have shrunk from basing
their claim on the only argument which can ultimately
be held to be a sufficient one&mdash;the assertion that
animals, as well as men, though, of course, to a far less
extent than men, are possessed of a distinctive individuality,
and therefore are in justice entitled to live
their lives with a due measure of that &#8220;restricted
freedom&#8221; to which Herbert Spencer alludes. It is of
little use to claim &#8220;rights&#8221; for animals in a vague
general way, if with the same breath we explicitly
show our determination to subordinate those rights to
anything and everything that can be construed into a
human &#8220;want&#8221;; nor will it ever be possible to obtain
full justice for the lower races so long as we continue
to regard them as beings of a wholly different order,
and to ignore the significance of their numberless
points of kinship with mankind.</p>

<p>For example, it has been said by a well-known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
writer on the subject of humanity to animals<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> that
&#8220;the life of a brute, having no moral purpose, can
best be understood ethically as representing the sum
of its <i>pleasures</i>; and the obligation, therefore, of producing
the pleasures of sentient creatures must be
reduced, in their case, to the abstinence from unnecessary
destruction of life.&#8221; Now, with respect to this
statement, I must say that the notion of the life of an
animal having &#8220;no moral purpose&#8221; belongs to a class
of ideas which cannot possibly be accepted by the
advanced humanitarian thought of the present day&mdash;it
is a purely arbitrary assumption, at variance with
our best science, and absolutely fatal (if the subject
be clearly thought out) to any full realization of
animals&#8217; rights. If we are ever going to do justice to
the lower races, we must get rid of the antiquated
notion of a &#8220;great gulf&#8221; fixed between them and
mankind, and must recognize the common bond of
humanity that unites all living beings in one universal
brotherhood.</p>

<p>As far as any excuses can be alleged, in explanation
of the insensibility or inhumanity of the western
nations in their treatment of animals, these excuses
may be mostly traced back to one or the other of two
theories, wholly different in origin, yet alike in this&mdash;that
both postulate an absolute difference of nature
between men and the lower kinds.</p>

<p>The first is the so-called &#8220;religious&#8221; notion, which
awards immortality to man, but to man alone, thereby
furnishing (especially in Catholic countries) a quibbling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
justification for acts of cruelty to animals, on the plea
that they &#8220;have no souls.&#8221; &#8220;It should seem,&#8221; says
Mrs. Jameson,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> &#8220;as if the primitive Christians, by laying
so much stress upon a future life, in contradistinction
to <i>this</i> life, and placing the lower creatures out of
the pale of hope, placed them at the same time out of
the pale of sympathy, and thus laid the foundation
for this utter disregard of animals in the light of our
fellow-creatures.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am aware that a quite contrary argument has, in
a few isolated instances, been founded on the belief that
animals have &#8220;no souls.&#8221; &#8220;Cruelty to a brute,&#8221; says an
old writer,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> &#8220;is an injury irreparable,&#8221; because there is
no future life to be a compensation for present afflictions;
and there is an amusing story, told by Mr. Lecky
in his &#8220;History of European Morals,&#8221; of a certain
humanely-minded Cardinal, who used to allow vermin
to bite him without hindrance, on the ground that
&#8220;we shall have heaven to reward us for our sufferings,
but these poor creatures have nothing but the enjoyment
of this present life.&#8221; But this is a rare view of the
question which need not, I think, be taken into very
serious account; for, on the whole, the denial of immortality
to animals (unless, of course, it be also
denied to men) tends strongly to lessen their chance
of being justly and considerately treated. Among
the many humane movements of the present age,
none is more significant than the growing inclination,
noticeable both in scientific circles and in religious, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
believe that mankind and the lower animals have the
same destiny before them.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The second and not less fruitful source of modern
inhumanity is to be found in the &#8220;Cartesian&#8221; doctrine&mdash;the
theory of Descartes and his followers&mdash;that the
lower animals are devoid of consciousness and feeling;
a theory which carried the &#8220;religious&#8221; notion a step
further, and deprived the animals not only of their
claim to a life hereafter, but of anything that could,
without mockery, be called a life in the present, since
mere &#8220;animated machines,&#8221; as they were thus affirmed
to be, could in no real sense be said to <i>live</i> at all!
Well might Voltaire turn his humane ridicule against
this most monstrous contention, and suggest, with
scathing irony, that God &#8220;had given the animals the
organs of feeling, to the end that they might <i>not</i> feel!&#8221;
&#8220;The theory of animal automatism,&#8221; says Professor
Romanes, &#8220;which is usually attributed to Descartes,
can never be accepted by common sense.&#8221; Yet it
is to be feared that it has done much, in its time,
to harden &#8220;scientific&#8221; sense against the just complaints
of the victims of human arrogance and oppression.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>Let me here quote a most impressive passage from
Schopenhauer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The unpardonable forgetfulness in which the lower
animals have hitherto been left by the moralists of Europe
is well known. It is pretended that the beasts have no
rights. They persuade themselves that our conduct in regard
to them has nothing to do with morals, or (to speak the
language of their morality) that we have no duties towards
animals: a doctrine revolting, gross, and barbarous, peculiar
to the west, and having its root in Judaism. In philosophy,
however, it is made to rest upon a hypothesis, admitted in
despite of evidence itself, of an absolute difference between
man and beast. It is Descartes who has proclaimed it in
the clearest and most decisive manner; and in fact it was a
necessary consequence of his errors. The Cartesian-Leibnitzian-Wolfian
philosophy, with the assistance of entirely
abstract notions, had built up the &#8216;rational psychology,&#8217; and
constructed an immortal <i>anima rationalis</i>: but, visibly, the
world of beasts, with its very natural claims, stood up against
this exclusive monopoly&mdash;this <i>brevet</i> of immortality decreed
to man alone&mdash;and silently Nature did what she always does
in such cases&mdash;she protested. Our philosophers, feeling
their scientific conscience quite disturbed, were forced to
attempt to consolidate their &#8216;rational psychology&#8217; by the aid
of empiricism. They therefore set themselves to work to
hollow out between man and beast an enormous abyss, of
an immeasurable width; by this they wish to prove to us,
in contempt of evidence, an impassable difference.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p></div>

<p>The fallacious idea that the lives of animals have
no moral purpose is at root connected with these religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
and philosophical pretensions which Schopenhauer
so powerfully condemns. To live one&#8217;s own
life&mdash;to realize one&#8217;s true self&mdash;is the highest moral
purpose of man and animal alike; and that animals
possess their due measure of this sense of individuality
is scarcely open to doubt. &#8220;We have seen,&#8221; says
Darwin, &#8220;that the senses and intuitions, the various
emotions and faculties, such as love, memory, attention,
curiosity, imitation, reason, etc., of which man
boasts, may be found in an incipient, or even sometimes
in a well-developed condition, in the lower
animals.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Not less emphatic is the testimony of the
Rev. J. G. Wood, who, speaking from a great experience,
gives it as his opinion that &#8220;the manner in which
we ignore individuality in the lower animals is simply
astounding.&#8221; He claims for them a future life, because
he is &#8220;quite sure that most of the cruelties which are
perpetrated on the animals are due to the habit of
considering them as mere machines without susceptibilities,
without reason, and without the capacity of a
future.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The long-maintained distinction between human
&#8220;reason&#8221; and animal &#8220;instinct&#8221; is being given up by
recent scientific writers, as, for example, by Dr. Wesley
Mills in his work on &#8220;The Nature and Development
of Animal Intelligence,&#8221; and by Mr. E. P. Evans in
&#8220;Evolutional Ethics and Animal Psychology.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The trend of investigation,&#8221; says Dr. Mills, &#8220;thus far
goes to show that at least the germ of every human faculty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
does exist in some species of animal.... Formerly the
line was drawn at reason. It was said that the &#8216;brutes&#8217;
cannot reason. Only persons who do not themselves reason
about the subject with the facts before them can any longer
occupy such a position. The evidence of reasoning power is
overwhelming for the upper ranks of animals, and yearly the
downward limits are being extended the more the inferior
tribes are studied.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>We have to get rid, as Mr. Evans points out, of
those &#8220;anthropocentric&#8221; delusions which &#8220;treat man
as a being essentially different and inseparably set
apart from all other sentient creatures, to which he is
bound by no ties of mental affinity or moral obligation.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Man is as truly a part and product of Nature as any
other animal, and this attempt to set him up as an isolated
point outside of it is philosophically false and morally
pernicious.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>This, then, is the position of those who assert that
animals, like men, are possessed of certain limited
rights, which cannot be withheld from them, as they
are now withheld, without tyranny and injustice. They
have individuality, character, reason; and to have
those qualities is to have the right to exercise them,
in so far as surrounding circumstances permit. No
human being is justified in regarding an animal as a
meaningless automaton, to be worked, or tortured, or
eaten, as the case may be, for the mere object of
satisfying the wants or whims of mankind. Together
with the destinies and duties that are laid on them
and fulfilled by them, animals have also the right to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
be treated with gentleness and consideration, and the
man who does not so treat them, however great his
learning or influence may be, is, in that respect, an
ignorant and foolish man, devoid of the highest and
noblest culture of which the human mind is capable.</p>

<p>Something must here be said on the important subject
of nomenclature. It is to be feared that the ill-treatment
of animals is largely caused&mdash;or at any rate
the difficulty of amending that treatment is largely
aggravated&mdash;by the common use of such terms as
&#8220;brute-beast,&#8221; &#8220;live-stock,&#8221; etc., which implicitly deny
to the lower races that intelligent individuality which
is undoubtedly possessed by them. It was long ago
remarked by Bentham, in his &#8220;Introduction to Principles
of Morals and Legislation,&#8221; that, whereas human
beings are styled <i>persons</i>, &#8220;other animals, on account
of their interests having been neglected by the insensibility
of the ancient jurists, stand degraded into the
class of <i>things</i>&#8221;; and Schopenhauer also has commented
on the mischievous absurdity of the idiom
which applies the neuter pronoun &#8220;it&#8221; to such highly-organized
animals as the dog and the ape.</p>

<p>A word of protest is needed also against such an
expression as &#8220;dumb animals,&#8221; which, though often
cited as &#8220;an immense exhortation to pity,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> has in
reality a tendency to influence ordinary people in
quite the contrary direction, inasmuch as it fosters the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
idea of an impassable barrier between mankind and
their dependents. It is convenient to us men to be
deaf to the entreaties of the victims of our injustice;
and, by a sort of grim irony, we therefore assume that
it is <i>they</i> who are afflicted by some organic incapacity&mdash;they
are &#8220;dumb animals,&#8221; forsooth! although a
moment&#8217;s consideration must prove that they have
innumerable ways, often quite human in variety and
suggestiveness, of uttering their thoughts and emotions.
Even the term &#8220;animals,&#8221; as applied to the
lower races, is incorrect, and not wholly unobjectionable,
since it ignores the fact that <i>man</i> is an animal no
less than they. My only excuse for using it in this
volume is that there is no better brief term available.</p>

<p>So anomalous is the attitude of man towards the
lower animals, that it is no marvel if many humane
thinkers have wellnigh despaired over this question.
&#8220;The whole subject of the brute creation,&#8221; wrote Dr.
Arnold, &#8220;is to me one of such painful mystery, that
I dare not approach it&#8221;; and this (to put the most
charitable interpretation on their silence) appears to
be the position of the majority of moralists and
teachers at the present time. Yet there is urgent need
of some solution of the problem; and in no other way
can this be found than by the admission of the lower
races within the pale of human sympathy. All the
promptings of our best and surest instincts point us
in this direction. &#8220;It is abundantly evident,&#8221; says
Lecky, &#8220;both from history and from present experience,
that the instinctive shock, or natural feelings of
disgust, caused by the sight of the sufferings of men,
is not generically different from that which is caused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
by the sight of the suffering of animals.&#8221; If this be
so, can it be seriously contended that the same
humanitarian tendency which has already emancipated
the slave, will not ultimately benefit the lower races
also? Here, again, the historian of &#8220;European
Morals&#8221; has a significant remark:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;At one time the benevolent affections embrace merely
the family, soon the circle expanding includes first a class,
then a nation, then a coalition of nations, then all humanity;
and finally its influence is felt in the dealings of man with
the animal world. In each of these cases a standard is
formed, different from that of the preceding stage, but in
each case the same tendency is recognized as virtue.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>But, it may be argued, vague sympathy with the
lower animals is one thing, and a definite recognition
of their &#8220;rights&#8221; is another; what reason is there to
suppose that we shall advance from the former phase
to the latter? Just this; that every great liberating
movement has proceeded exactly on such lines.
Oppression and cruelty are invariably founded on a
lack of imaginative sympathy; the tyrant or tormentor
can have no true sense of kinship with the victim
of his injustice. When once the sense of affinity is
awakened, the knell of tyranny is sounded, and the
ultimate concession of &#8220;rights&#8221; is simply a matter of
time. The present condition of the more highly-organized
domestic animals is in many ways very analogous
to that of the negro slaves of a hundred years ago:
look back, and you will find in their case precisely the
same exclusion from the common pale of humanity;
the same hypocritical fallacies, to justify that exclusion;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
and, as a consequence, the same deliberate
stubborn denial of their social &#8220;rights.&#8221; Look back&mdash;for
it is well to do so&mdash;and then look forward, and
the moral can hardly be mistaken.</p>

<p>We find so great a thinker as Aristotle seriously
pondering, in his &#8220;Ethics,&#8221; whether a slave may be
considered as a fellow-being. In emphasizing the point
that friendship is founded on propinquity, he expresses
himself as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Neither can men have friendships with horses, cattle, or
slaves, considered merely as such; for a slave is merely a
living instrument, and an instrument a lifeless slave. Yet,
considered as a man, a slave may be an object of friendship,
for certain rights seem to belong to all those capable of participating
in law and engagement.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Slaves, says Bentham,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;have been treated by the law exactly upon the same
footing as in England, for example, the inferior races of
animals are still. The day may come when the rest of the
animal creation may acquire those rights which could never
have been withholden from them but by the hand of tyranny.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Let us unreservedly admit the immense difficulties
that stand in the way of this animal enfranchisement.
Our relation towards the animals is complicated and
embittered by innumerable habits handed down through
centuries of brutality and mistrust; we cannot, in all
cases, suddenly relax these habits, or do full justice
even where we see that justice will have to be done.
A perfect ethic of humaneness is therefore impracticable,
if not unthinkable; and we can attempt to do
no more than to indicate in a general way the main<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
principle of animals&#8217; rights, noting at the same time
the most flagrant particular violations of those rights,
and the lines on which the only valid reform can
hereafter be effected. But, on the other hand, it may
be remembered, for the comfort and encouragement of
humanitarian workers, that these obstacles are, after
all, only such as are inevitable in each branch of
social improvement; for at every stage of every great
reformation it has been repeatedly argued, by indifferent
or hostile observers, that further progress is impossible;
indeed, when the opponents of a great cause
begin to demonstrate its &#8220;impossibility,&#8221; experience
teaches us that that cause is already on the high road
to fulfilment.</p>

<p>As for the demand so frequently made on reformers,
that they should first explain the details of their
scheme&mdash;how this and that point will be arranged,
and by what process all kinds of difficulties, real or
imagined, will be circumvented&mdash;the only rational
reply is that it is absurd to expect to see the end of a
question when we are now but at its beginning. The
persons who offer this futile sort of criticism are usually
those who under no circumstances would be open to
conviction; they purposely ask for an explanation
which, by the very nature of the case, is impossible
because it necessarily belongs to a later period of time.
It would be equally sensible to request a traveller to
enumerate beforehand all the particular things he will
see by the way, on pain of being denounced as an unpractical
visionary, although he may have a quite
sufficient general knowledge of his course and destination.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>Our main principle is now clear. If &#8220;rights&#8221; exist
at all&mdash;and both feeling and usage indubitably prove
that they do exist&mdash;they cannot be consistently
awarded to men and denied to animals, since the
same sense of justice and compassion apply in both
cases. &#8220;Pain is pain,&#8221; says Humphry Primatt,
&#8220;whether it be inflicted on man or on beast; and the
creature that suffers it, whether man or beast, being
sensible of the misery of it while it lasts, suffers <i>evil</i>;
and the sufferance of evil, unmeritedly, unprovokedly,
where no offence has been given, and no good can
possibly be answered by it, but merely to exhibit
power or gratify malice, is Cruelty and Injustice in
him that occasions it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I commend this outspoken utterance to the attention
of those ingenious moralists who quibble about
the &#8220;discipline&#8221; of suffering, and deprecate immediate
attempts to redress what, it is alleged, may be a necessary
instrument for the attainment of human welfare.
It is perhaps a mere coincidence, but it may be
observed that those who are most forward to disallow
the rights of others, and to argue that suffering and
subjection are the natural lot of all living things, are
usually themselves exempt from the operation of this
beneficent law, and that the beauty of self-sacrifice is
most loudly belauded by those who profit most largely
at the expense of their fellow-beings.</p>

<p>But &#8220;nature is one with rapine,&#8221; say some, and this
utopian theory of &#8220;rights,&#8221; if too widely extended, must
come in conflict with that iron rule of internecine competition
by which the universe is regulated. But is the
universe so regulated? We note that this very objection,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
which was confidently relied on a few years back by
many opponents of the emancipation of the working-classes,
is not heard of in that connection now. Our
learned economists and men of science, who set themselves
to play the defenders of the social <i>status quo</i>, have
seen their own weapons of &#8220;natural selection,&#8221; &#8220;survival
of the fittest,&#8221; and what not, snatched from their hands
and turned against them, and are therefore beginning
to explain to us, in a scientific manner, what we untutored
humanitarians had previously felt to be true,
viz., that competition is not by any means the sole
governing law among the human race. We are not
greatly dismayed, then, to find the same old bugbear
trotted out as an argument against animals&#8217; rights&mdash;indeed,
we see already unmistakable signs of a similar
reversal of the scientific judgment.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The charge of &#8220;sentimentalism&#8221; is frequently
brought against those who plead for animals&#8217; rights.
Now &#8220;sentimentalism,&#8221; if any meaning at all can be
attached to the word, must signify an inequality, an
ill balance of sentiment, an inconsistency which leads
men into attacking one abuse, while they ignore or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
condone another where a reform is equally desirable.
That this weakness is often observable among &#8220;philanthropists&#8221;
on the one hand, and &#8220;friends of
animals&#8221; on the other, and most of all among those
acute &#8220;men of the world,&#8221; whose regard is only for
themselves, I am not concerned to deny; what I
wish to point out is, that the only real safeguard against
sentimentality is to take up a consistent position towards
the rights of men and of the lower animals alike,
and to cultivate a broad sense of universal justice (not
&#8220;mercy&#8221;) for all living things. Herein, and herein
alone, is to be sought the true sanity of temperament.</p>

<p>It is an entire mistake to suppose that the rights of
animals are in any way antagonistic to the rights of
men. Let us not be betrayed for a moment into the
specious fallacy that we must study human rights
first, and leave the animal question to solve itself
hereafter; for it is only by a wide and disinterested
study of <i>both</i> subjects that a solution of either is
possible. &#8220;For he who loves all animated nature,&#8221;
says Porphyry, &#8220;will not hate any one tribe of innocent
beings, and by how much greater his love for the
whole, by so much the more will he cultivate justice
towards a part of them, and that part to which he is
most allied.&#8221; To omit all worthier reasons, it is too
late in the day to suggest the indefinite postponement
of a consideration of animals&#8217; rights, for from a moral
point of view, and even from a legislative point of
view, we are daily confronted with the problem, and
the so-called &#8220;practical&#8221; people who affect to ignore
it are simply shutting their eyes to facts which they
find it disagreeable to confront.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>Once more then, animals have rights, and these
rights consist in the &#8220;restricted freedom&#8221; to live a
natural life&mdash;a life, that is, which permits of the individual
development&mdash;subject to the limitations imposed
by the permanent needs and interests of the
community. There is nothing quixotic or visionary
in this assertion; it is perfectly compatible with a
readiness to look the sternest laws of existence fully
and honestly in the face. If we must kill, whether it
be man or animal, let us kill and have done with it;
if we must inflict pain, let us do what is inevitable,
without hypocrisy, or evasion, or cant. But (here is
the cardinal point) let us first be assured that it <i>is</i>
necessary; let us not wantonly trade on the needless
miseries of other beings, and then attempt to lull our
consciences by a series of shuffling excuses which cannot
endure a moment&#8217;s candid investigation. As
Leigh Hunt well says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;That there is pain and evil, is no rule</div>
<div class="verse">That I should make it greater, like a fool.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Thus far the general principle of animals&#8217; rights.
We will now proceed to apply this principle to a
number of particular cases, from which we may learn
something both as to the extent of its present violation,
and the possibility of its better observance in the
future.</p>

<small>THE CASE OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> main principle of animals&#8217; rights, if admitted to
be fundamentally sound, will not be essentially affected
by the wildness or the domesticity, as the case may
be, of the animals in question; <i>both</i> classes have their
rights, though these rights may differ largely in extent
and importance. It is convenient, however, to consider
the subject of the domestic animals apart from
that of the wild ones, inasmuch as their whole relation
to mankind is so much altered and emphasized by the
fact of their subjection. Here, at any rate, it is impossible,
even for the most callous reasoners, to deny
the responsibility of man, in his dealings with vast
races of beings, the very conditions of whose existence
have been modified by human civilization.</p>

<p>An incalculable mass of drudgery, at the cost of
incalculable suffering, is daily, hourly performed for
the benefit of man by these honest, patient labourers
in every town and country of the world. Are these
countless services to be permanently ignored in a
community which makes any pretension to a humane
civilization? Will the free citizens of the enlightened
republics of the future be content to reap the immense
advantages of animals&#8217; labour, without recognizing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
that they owe them some consideration in return?
The question is one that carries with it its own
answer.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>But the human mind is subtle to evade the full significance
of its duties, and nowhere is this more conspicuously
seen than in our treatment of the lower
races. Given a position in which man profits largely
(or <i>thinks</i> he profits largely, for it is not always a
matter of certainty) by the toil or suffering of the
animals, and our respectable moralists are pretty sure
to be explaining to us that this providential arrangement
is &#8220;better for the animals themselves.&#8221; The
wish is father to the thought in these questions, and
there is an accommodating elasticity in our social
ethics that permits of the justification of almost any
system which it would be inconvenient to us to discontinue.
Thus we find it stated, and on the authority
of a bishop, that man may &#8220;lay down the terms of the
social contract between animals and himself,&#8221; because,
forsooth, &#8220;the general life of a domestic animal is one
of very great comfort&mdash;according to the animal&#8217;s own
standard (<i>sic</i>) probably one of almost perfect happiness.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Now this prating about &#8220;the animal&#8217;s own standard&#8221;
is nothing better than hypocritical cant. If man is
obliged to lay down the terms of the contract, let him
at least do so without having recourse to such a suspiciously
opportune afterthought. We have taken the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
animals from a free, natural state, into an artificial
thraldom, in order that <i>we</i>, and not <i>they</i>, may be the
gainers thereby; it cannot possibly be maintained
that they owe us gratitude on this account, or that
this alleged debt may be used as a means of evading
the just recognition of their rights. It is the more
necessary to raise a strong protest against this jesuitical
mode of reasoning, because, as we shall see, it is so
frequently employed, in one form or another, by the
apologists of human tyranny.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I desire to keep clear also of the
extreme contrary contention, that man is not morally
justified in imposing any sort of subjection on the
lower animals.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> An abstract question of this sort,
however interesting as a speculation, and impossible
in itself to disprove, is beyond the scope of the present
inquiry, which is primarily concerned with the
state of things at present existing. We must face the
fact that the services of domestic animals have become,
whether rightly or wrongly, an integral portion of the
system of modern society; we cannot immediately
dispense with those services, any more than we can
dispense with human labour itself. But we <i>can</i> provide,
as at least a present step towards a more ideal
relationship in the future, that the conditions under
which all labour is performed, whether by men or by
animals, shall be such as to enable the worker to take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
some appreciable pleasure in the work, instead of
experiencing a lifelong course of injustice and ill-treatment.</p>

<p>And here it may be convenient to say a word as to
the existing line of demarcation between the animals
legally recognized as &#8220;domestic,&#8221; and those <i>fer&aelig;
natur&aelig;</i>, of wild nature. In the Act of 1849, in which
a penalty was imposed for cruelty to &#8220;any animal,&#8221; it
was expressly provided that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The word <i>animal</i> shall be taken to mean any horse,
mare, gelding, bull, ox, cow, heifer, steer, calf, mule, ass,
sheep, lamb, hog, pig, sow, goat, dog, cat, or any other
domestic animal.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>But as time went on, and public opinion was more
sensitive, the interpretation of this vague reference
to &#8220;any other domestic animal&#8221; became a point of
considerable importance, since it closely affected the
welfare of certain captive animals which, though
regarded as wild, and therefore outside the pale of
protection, were to all intents and purposes in a state
of domestication. The Act of 1849 was accordingly
amended by the Wild Animals in Captivity Act of
1900, which made it an offence to maltreat a wild
animal while actually in a state of captivity. (<i>See also</i>
the Act of 1911, <i>infra</i> p. 34.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Food, rest, and tender usage,&#8221; were declared by
Humphry Primatt, the old author already quoted, to
be the three rights of the domestic animals. Lawrence&#8217;s
opinion was to much the same effect.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Man is indispensably bound to bestow upon animals, in
return for the benefit he derives from their services, good
and sufficient nourishment, comfortable shelter, and merciful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
treatment; to commit no wanton outrage upon their feelings,
whilst alive, and to put them to the speediest and least
painful death, when it shall be necessary to deprive them of
life.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>But it is important to note that something more is
due to animals, and especially to domestic animals,
than the mere supply of provender and the mere immunity
from ill-usage. &#8220;We owe justice to men,&#8221;
wrote Montaigne, &#8220;and grace and benignity to other
creatures that are capable of it; there is a natural
commerce and mutual obligation betwixt them and
us.&#8221; Sir Arthur Helps admirably expressed this
sentiment in his well-known reference to the duty of
&#8220;using courtesy to animals.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>If these be the rights of domestic animals, it is
pitiful to reflect how commonly and how grossly they
are violated. The average life of our &#8220;beasts of
burden,&#8221; the horse, the ass, and the mule, is from
beginning to end a rude negation of their individuality
and intelligence; they are habitually addressed and
treated as stupid instruments of man&#8217;s will and pleasure,
instead of the highly-organized and sensitive
beings that they are. Well might Thoreau, the
humanest and most observant of naturalists, complain
of man&#8217;s &#8220;not educating the horse, not trying to
develop his nature, but merely getting work out of
him&#8221;; for such, it must be acknowledged, is the prevalent
method of treatment, in ninety-nine cases out
of a hundred, at the present day, even where there is
no actual cruelty or ill-usage.</p>

<p>We are often told that there is no other western<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
country where tame animals are so well treated as in
England, and it is only necessary to read the records
of a century back to see that the inhumanities of the
past were far more atrocious than any that are still
practised in the present. Let us be thankful for these
facts, as showing that the current of English opinion
is at least moving in the right direction. But it must
yet be said that the sights that everywhere meet the
eye of a humane and thoughtful observer, whether in
town or country, are a disgrace to our vaunted &#8220;civilization.&#8221;
Watch the cab traffic in one of the crowded
thoroughfares of our great cities&mdash;always the same
lugubrious patient procession of underfed overloaded
animals, the same brutal insolence of the drivers, the
same accursed sound of the whip. And remembering
that these horses are gifted with a large degree of
sensibility and intelligence, must one not feel that the
fate to which they are thus mercilessly subjected is a
shameful violation of the principle which moralists
have laid down?</p>

<p>Yet it is to this fate that even the well-kept horses
of the rich must in time descend, so to pass the
declining years of a life devoted to man&#8217;s service! &#8220;A
good man,&#8221; said Plutarch, &#8220;will take care of his horses
and dogs, not only while they are young, but when
old and past service. We ought certainly not to treat
living beings like shoes and household goods, which,
when worn out with use, we throw away.&#8221; Such was
the feeling of the old pagan writer, and our good
Christians of the present age scarcely seem to have
improved on it. True, they do not &#8220;throw away&#8221;
their superannuated carriage-horses&mdash;it is so much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
more lucrative to <i>sell</i> them to the shopman or cab-proprietor,
who will in due course pass them on to the
knacker and cat&#8217;s-meat man.</p>

<p>The use of machinery is often condemned, on
&aelig;sthetic grounds, because of the ugliness it has introduced
into so many features of modern life. On the
other hand, it should not be forgotten that it has immensely
relieved the huge mass of animal labour, and
that when such forces are generally used for purposes
of traction, one of the foulest blots on our social humanity
is likely to disappear. Scientific and mechanical
invention, so far from being necessarily antagonistic
to a true beauty of life, may be found to be of the utmost
service to it, when they are employed for humane and
not merely commercial, purposes.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Herein Thoreau
is a wiser teacher than Ruskin. &#8220;If all were as it
seems,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and men made the elements their
servants for noble ends! If the cloud that hangs over
the engine were the perspiration of heroic deeds, or
as beneficent as that which floats over the farmer&#8217;s
fields, then the elements and Nature herself would
cheerfully accompany men on their errands and be
their escort.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is no part of my purpose to enumerate the
various acts of injustice of which domestic animals
are the victims; it is sufficient to point out that the
true cause of such injustice is to be sought in the unwarrantable
neglect of their many intelligent qualities,
and in the contemptuous indifference which, in defiance
of sense and reason, still classes them as &#8220;brute-beasts.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
What has been said of horses in this respect
applies still more strongly to the second class of
domestic animals. Sheep, goats, and oxen are regarded
as mere &#8220;live-stock&#8221;; while pigs, poultry,
rabbits, and other marketable &#8220;farm-produce,&#8221; meet
with even less consideration, and are constantly treated
with brutal inhumanity by their human possessors.
Let anyone who doubts this pay a visit to a cattle-market,
and study the scenes that are enacted there.</p>

<p>The question of the castration of animals may here
be briefly referred to.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> That nothing but imperative
necessity could justify such a practice must, I think, be
admitted; for mutilation of this kind is not only
painful in itself, but deprives those who undergo it of
the most vigorous and spirited elements of their
character. It is said&mdash;with what precise amount of
truth I cannot pretend to determine&mdash;that man would
not otherwise be able to maintain his dominion over
the domestic animals; but on the other hand it may
be pointed out that this dominion is in no case
destined to be perpetuated in its present sharply-accentuated
form, and that various practices which, in
a sense, are &#8220;necessary&#8221; now,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> in the false position
and relationship in which we stand towards the animals,&mdash;will
doubtless be gradually discontinued under the
humaner system of the future. Moreover, castration
as performed on cattle, sheep, pigs, and fowls, with no
better object than to increase their size and improve
their flavour for the table, is, even at the present time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
utterly needless and unjustifiable. &#8220;The bull,&#8221; as Shelley
says, &#8220;must be degraded into the ox, and the ram into
the wether, by an unnatural and inhuman operation,
that the flaccid fibre may offer a fainter resistance to
rebellious nature.&#8221; In all its aspects, this is a disagreeable
subject, and one about which the majority of people
do not care to think&mdash;probably from an unconscious
perception that the established custom could scarcely
survive the critical ordeal of thought.</p>

<p>There remains one other class of domestic animals,
viz., those who have become still more closely associated
with mankind through being the inmates of
their homes. The dog is probably better treated on
the whole than any other animal;<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> though, to prove
how far we still are from a rational and consistent
appreciation of his worth, it is only necessary to point
to the fact that he is commonly regarded by a large
number of educated people as a fit and proper subject
for that experimental torture which is known as vivisection.
The cat has always been treated with far less
consideration than the dog, and, despite the numerous
scattered instances that might be cited to the contrary,
it is to be feared that De Quincey was in the main
correct, when he remarked that &#8220;the groans and
screams of this poor persecuted race, if gathered into
some great echoing hall of horrors, would melt the
heart of the stoniest.&#8221; The institution of &#8220;Homes&#8221;
for lost and starving dogs and cats is a welcome sign
of the humane feeling that is asserting itself in some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
quarters; but it is also no less a proof of the general
indifferentism which can allow the most familiar domestic
animals to become homeless.</p>

<p>It may be doubted, indeed, whether the condition
of the household &#8220;pet&#8221; is, in the long run, more
enviable than that of the &#8220;beast of burden.&#8221; Pets,
like kings&#8217; favourites, are usually the recipients of an
abundance of sentimental affection but of little real
kindness; so much easier is it to give temporary
caresses than substantial justice. It seems to be
forgotten, in a vast majority of cases, that a domestic
animal does not exist for the mere idle amusement,
any more than for the mere commercial profit, of its
human owner; and that for a living being to be turned
into a useless puppet is only one degree better than to
be doomed to the servitude of a drudge. The injustice
done to the pampered lap-dog is as conspicuous, in its
way, as that done to the over-worked horse, and both
spring from one and the same origin&mdash;the fixed belief
that the life of a &#8220;brute&#8221; has no moral purpose, no
distinctive personality worthy of due consideration
and development. In a society where the lower
animals were regarded as intelligent beings, and not
as animated machines, it would be impossible for this
incongruous absurdity to continue.</p>

<p>This, then, appears to be our position as regards
the rights of domestic animals. Waiving, on the one
hand, the somewhat abstruse question whether man
is morally justified in utilizing animal labour at all,
and on the other the fatuous assertion that he is
constituting himself a benefactor by so doing, we
recognize that the services of domestic animals have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
by immemorial usage become an important and, it
may even be said, necessary element in the economy
of modern life. It is impossible, unless every principle
of justice is to be cast to the winds, that the due
requital of these services should remain a matter of
personal caprice; for slavery is at all times hateful
and iniquitous, whether it be imposed on mankind
or on the lower races. Apart from the rights they
possess in common with all intelligent beings, domestic
animals have a special claim on man&#8217;s courtesy and
sense of fairness, inasmuch as they are not his fellow-creatures
only, but his fellow-workers, his dependents,
and in many cases the familiar associates and trusted
inmates of his home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br />


<small>THE CASE OF WILD ANIMALS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> wild animals, no less than domestic animals,
have their rights, albeit of a less positive character
and far less easy to define, is an essential point which
follows directly from the acceptance of the general
principle of a <i>jus animalium</i>. It is of the utmost importance
to emphasize the fact that, whatever the
<i>legal</i> fiction may have been, or may still be, the rights
of animals are not <i>morally</i> dependent on the so-called
rights of property.</p>

<p>The domination of property has left its trail indelibly
on the records of this question. Until the passing of
&#8220;Martin&#8217;s Act&#8221; in 1822, the most atrocious cruelty,
even to domestic animals, could only be punished
where there was proved to be an infringement of the
rights of ownership. Some measure of legal protection
was, as I have said, accorded to wild animals in the
Wild Animals in Captivity Act of 1900, which was
repealed, re-enacted, and extended in the Protection
of Animals Act, 1911; which Act was itself strengthened
by an Amendment passed in 1921, prohibiting
the coursing or hunting of a wild animal in an
enclosed space from which it has no reasonable chance
of escape. With this exception, it is permissible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
for anyone to kill or torture them with impunity,
except where the sacred privileges of &#8220;property&#8221; are
thereby offended. &#8220;Everywhere,&#8221; it has been well
said, &#8220;it is absolutely a capital crime to be an unowned
creature.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet surely an unowned creature has the same right
as another to live his life unmolested and uninjured
except when this is in some way inimical to human
welfare. We are justified by the strongest of all
instincts, that of self-defence, in safe-guarding ourselves
against such a multiplication of any species of animal
as might imperil the established supremacy of man;
but we are <i>not</i> justified in unnecessarily killing&mdash;still
less in torturing&mdash;any harmless being whatsoever. In
this respect the position of wild animals, in their
relation to man, is somewhat analogous to that of the
uncivilized towards the civilized nations. Nothing is
more difficult than to determine precisely to what extent
it is morally permissible to interfere with the
autonomy of savage tribes&mdash;an interference which
seems in some cases to conduce to the general progress
of the race, in others to foster the worst forms of
cruelty and injustice; but it is beyond question that
savages, like other people, have the right to be exempt
from all wanton insult and degradation.</p>

<p>In the same way, while admitting that man is
justified, by the exigencies of his own destiny, in
asserting his supremacy over the wild animals, we
must deny him any right to turn his protectorate into
a tyranny, or to inflict one atom more of subjection
and pain than is absolutely unavoidable. To take
advantage of the sufferings of animals, whether wild<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
or tame, for the gratification of sport, or gluttony, or
fashion, is quite incompatible with any possible assertion
of animals&#8217; rights. We may kill, if necessary, but
never torture or degrade.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The laws of self-defence,&#8221; says an old writer,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> &#8220;undoubtedly
justify us in destroying those animals who would
destroy us, who injure our properties or annoy our persons;
but not even these, whenever their situation incapacitates
them from hurting us. I know of no right which we have
to shoot a bear on an inaccessible island of ice, or an eagle
on the mountain&#8217;s top, whose lives cannot injure us, nor
deaths procure us any benefit. We are unable to give life,
and therefore ought not to take it away from the meanest
insect without sufficient reason.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>I reserve, for fuller consideration in subsequent
chapters, certain problems which are suggested by the
wholesale slaughter of wild animals by the huntsman
or the trapper, for purposes which are loosely supposed
to be inevitable. Meantime a word must be said
about the condition of those tamed or caged animals
which, though wild by nature, and not bred in captivity,
are yet to a certain extent &#8220;domesticated&#8221;&mdash;a class
which stands midway between the true domestic and
the wild. Is the imprisonment of such animals a
violation of the principle we have laid down? In most
cases I fear this question can only be answered in the
affirmative.</p>

<p>And here, once more I must protest against the
common assumption that these captive animals are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
laid <i>under an obligation</i> to man by the very fact of
their captivity, and that therefore no complaint can be
made on the score of their loss of freedom and the
many miseries involved therein! It is extraordinary
that even humane thinkers and earnest champions of
animals&#8217; rights should permit themselves to be misled
by this most fallacious and flimsy line of argument.
&#8220;Harmful animals,&#8221; says one of these writers,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> &#8220;and
animals with whom man has to struggle for the fruits
of the earth, may of course be so shut up: they gain
by it, for otherwise they would not have been let live.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so in like manner it is sometimes contended
that a menagerie is a sort of paradise for wild beasts,
whose loss of liberty is more than compensated by the
absence of the constant apprehension and insecurity
which, it is conveniently assumed, weigh so heavily on
their spirits. But all this notion of their &#8220;gaining by
it&#8221; is in truth nothing more than a mere arbitrary
supposition; for, in the first place, a speedy death
may, for all we know, be very preferable to a protracted
death-in-life; while, secondly, the pretence that wild
animals enjoy captivity is even more absurd than the
episcopal contention that the life of a domestic animal
is &#8220;one of very great comfort, according to the animal&#8217;s
own standard.&#8221;</p>

<p>To take a wild animal from its free natural state,
full of abounding egoism and vitality, and to shut it
up for the wretched remainder of its life in a cell where
it has just space to turn round, and where it necessarily
loses every distinctive feature of its character&mdash;this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
appears to me to be as downright a denial as could
well be imagined of the theory of animals&#8217; rights.
Nor is there much force in the plea founded on the
alleged scientific value of these zoological institutions,
at any rate in the case of the wilder and less tractable
animals, for it cannot be maintained that the establishment
of wild-beast shows is in any way necessary for
the advancement of human knowledge. For what do
the good people see, who go to the gardens on a half-holiday
afternoon to poke their umbrellas at a blinking
eagle-owl, or to throw dog-biscuits down the expansive
throat of a hippopotamus? Not wild beasts or wild
birds certainly, for there never have been or can be
such in the best of all possible menageries, but merely
the outer semblances and <i>simulacra</i> of the denizens of
forest and prairie&mdash;poor spiritless remnants of what
were formerly wild animals. To kill and stuff these
victims of our morbid curiosity, instead of immuring
them in lifelong imprisonment, would be at once a
humaner and a cheaper method, and could not possibly
be of less use to science.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>But of course these remarks do not apply, with anything
like the same force, to the taming of such wild
animals as are readily domesticated in captivity, or
trained by man to some intelligible and practical
purpose. For example, though we may look forward
to the time when it will not be deemed necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
convert wild elephants into beasts of burden, it must
be acknowledged that the exaction of such service,
however questionable in itself, is very different from
condemning an animal to a long term of useless and
deadening imbecility. There can be no absolute
standard of morals in these matters, whether it be
human liberty or animal liberty that is at stake; I
merely contend that it is as incumbent on us to show
good reason for curtailing the one as the other. This
would be at once recognized, but for the prevalent
habit of regarding the lower animals as devoid of purpose
and individuality.</p>

<p>The caging of wild song-birds is another practice
which deserves the strongest reprobation. It is often
pleaded that the amusement given by these unfortunate
prisoners to the still more unfortunate human prisoners
of the sick-room, or the smoky city, is a justification of
their sacrifice; but surely such excuses rest only on
habit&mdash;habitual inability or unwillingness to look facts
in the face. Few invalids, I fancy, would be greatly
cheered by the captive life that hangs at their window,
if they had fully considered how blighted and sterilized
a life it must be. The bird-catcher&#8217;s trade and the
bird-catcher&#8217;s shop are alike full of horrors, and they
are horrors which are due entirely to a silly fashion
and a habit of callous thoughtlessness, not on the part
of the ruffianly bird-catcher (ruffianly enough, too
often) who has to bear the burden of the odium attaching
to these cruelties, but of the respectable customers
who buy captured larks and linnets without the
smallest scruple or consideration.</p>

<p>Finally, let me point out that if we desire to cultivate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
a closer intimacy with the wild animals, it must be an
intimacy based on a genuine love for them as living
beings and fellow-creatures, not on the superior power
or cunning by which we can drag them from their
native haunts, warp the whole purpose of their lives,
and degrade them to the level of pets, or curiosities,
or captives. The sanctuaries which the parks of some
large towns now afford to birds, squirrels, etc., suggest
what our relations with wild animals <i>might</i> be, under
more humane conditions.</p>

<p>Of all uses to which animals can be put&mdash;and this
applies to the domesticated as well as to the wild&mdash;the
silliest, perhaps, is that of training them to &#8220;perform.&#8221;
The true interest of animal life lies in its
naturalness; and to see a dog, or horse, or lion
performing a &#8220;trick&#8221; is a sight which ought to cause
disgust rather than pleasure in any rational mind,
especially as the process of training in most, if not
in all cases, involves the practice of cruelty. Humane
persons should discountenance every sort of entertainment
in which animals are introduced, from the
dancing bear in the village to the more elaborate but
not less idiotic performances on the stage. Many of
them are cruel; all of them are stupid; most of them
are both.</p>

<small>THE SLAUGHTER OF ANIMALS FOR FOOD.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is impossible that any discussion of the principle
of animals&#8217; rights can be at all adequate or conclusive
which ignores, as many so-called humanitarians still
ignore, the immense underlying importance of the food
question. The origin of the habit of flesh-eating need
not greatly concern us; let us assume, in accordance
with the most favoured theory, that animals were first
slaughtered by the uncivilized migratory tribes under
the stress of want, and that the practice thus engendered,
being fostered by the religious idea of blood-offering
and propitiation, survived and increased after the early
conditions which produced it had passed away. What
is more important to note, is that the very prevalence
of the habit has caused it to be regarded as a necessary
feature of modern civilization, and that this view has
inevitably had a marked effect, and a very detrimental
effect, on the study of man&#8217;s moral relation to the
lower animals.</p>

<p>Now it must be admitted, I think, that it is a difficult
thing consistently to recognize or assert the rights of
an animal on whom you purpose to make a meal, a
difficulty which has not been at all satisfactorily surmounted
by those moralists who, while accepting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
practice of flesh-eating as an institution which is itself
beyond cavil, have nevertheless been anxious to find
some solid basis for a theory of humaneness. &#8220;Strange
contrariety of conduct,&#8221; says Goldsmith&#8217;s &#8220;Chinese
Philosopher,&#8221; in commenting on this dilemma; &#8220;they
pity, and they <i>eat</i> the objects of their compassion!&#8221;
There is also the further consideration that the sanction
implicitly given to the terrible cruelties inflicted on
harmless cattle by the drover and the slaughterman
render it, by parity of reasoning, wellnigh impossible
to abolish many other acts of injustice that we see
everywhere around us; and this obstacle the opponents
of humanitarian reform have not been slow to utilize.
Hence a disposition on the part of many humane
writers to fight shy of the awkward subject of the
slaughter-house, or to gloss it over with a series of contradictory
and quite irrelevant excuses.</p>

<p>Let me give a few examples.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;We deprive animals of life,&#8221; says Bentham, in a delightfully
na&iuml;ve application of the utilitarian philosophy, &#8220;and
this is justifiable; their pains do not equal our enjoyments.&#8221;</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;By the scheme of universal providence,&#8221; says Lawrence,
&#8220;the services between man and beast are intended to be
reciprocal, and the greater part of the latter can by no other
means requite human labour and care than by the forfeiture
of life.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Schopenhauer&#8217;s plea is somewhat similar to the foregoing:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Man deprived of all flesh-food, especially in the north,
would suffer more than the animal suffers in a swift and unforeseen
death; still we ought to mitigate it by the help of
chloroform.&#8221;</p></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>Then there is the argument so frequently founded
on the supposed sanction of Nature.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;My scruples,&#8221; wrote Lord Chesterfield, &#8220;remained unreconciled
to the committing of so horrid a meal, till upon
serious reflection I became convinced of its legality from the
general order of Nature, which has instituted the universal
preying upon the weaker as one of her first principles.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Finally, we find the redoubtable Paley discarding
as valueless the whole appeal to Nature, and relying
on the ordinances of Holy Writ.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;A right to the flesh of animals. Some excuse seems
necessary for the pain and loss which we occasion to animals
by restraining them of their liberty, mutilating their bodies,
and at last putting an end to their lives for our pleasure or
convenience. The reasons alleged in vindication of this
practice are the following: that the several species of animals
being created to prey upon one another affords a kind of
analogy to prove that the human species were intended to
feed upon them.... Upon which reason I would observe
that the analogy contended for is extremely lame, since
animals have no power to support life by any other means,
and since we have, for the whole human species might subsist
entirely upon fruit, pulse, herbs, and roots, as many
tribes of Hindus actually do.... It seems to me that it
would be difficult to defend this right by any arguments
which the light and order of Nature afford, and that we are
beholden for it to the permission recorded in Scripture.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>It is evident from the above quotations, which
might be indefinitely extended, that the fable of the
Wolf and the Lamb is constantly repeating itself in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
the attitude of our moralists and philosophers towards
the victims of the slaughter-house. Far wiser and
humaner, on this particular subject, is the tone adopted
by such writers as Michelet, who, while not seeing
any way of escape from the practice of flesh-eating,
at least refrain from attempting to support it by fallacious
reasonings.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The animals below us have also their rights before God.
Animal life, sombre mystery! Immense world of thoughts
and of dumb sufferings! All nature protests against the
barbarity of man, who misapprehends, who humiliates, who
tortures his inferior brethren.... Life&mdash;death! The daily
murder which feeding upon animals implies&mdash;those hard
and bitter problems sternly placed themselves before my
mind. Miserable contradiction! Let us hope that there
may be another globe in which the base, the cruel fatalities
of this may be spared to us.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p></div>

<p>Meantime, however, the simple fact remains true,
and is every year finding more and more scientific
corroboration, that there is no such &#8220;cruel fatality&#8221; as
that which Michelet imagined. Comparative anatomy
has shown that man is not carnivorous, but frugivorous,
in his natural structure; experience has shown that
flesh-food is wholly unnecessary for the support of
healthy life. The importance of this more general
recognition of a truth which has in all ages been
familiar to a few enlightened thinkers, can hardly be
over-estimated in its bearing on the question of
animals&#8217; rights. It clears away a difficulty which has
long damped the enthusiasm, or warped the judgment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
of the humaner school of European moralists, and
makes it possible to approach the subject of man&#8217;s
moral relation to the lower animals in a more candid
and fearless spirit of enquiry. It is no part of my
present purpose to advocate the cause of vegetarianism;
but in view of the mass of evidence, readily obtainable,
that the transit and slaughter of animals are necessarily
attended by most atrocious cruelties, and that a
large number of persons have for years been living
healthily without the use of flesh-meat, it must at
least be said that to omit this branch of the subject
from the most earnest and strenuous consideration is
playing with the question of animals&#8217; rights. Fifty
or a hundred years ago, there was perhaps some
excuse for supposing that vegetarianism was a mere
fad; there is absolutely no such excuse at the present
time.</p>

<p>There are two points of especial significance in this
connection. First, that as civilization advances, the
cruelties inseparable from the slaughtering system
have been aggravated rather than diminished, owing
both to the increased necessity of transporting animals
long distances by sea and land, under conditions of
hurry and hardship which generally preclude any sort
of humane regard for their comfort, and to the clumsy
and barbarous methods of slaughtering too often practised
in those ill-constructed dens of torment known
as &#8220;private slaughter-houses.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Secondly, that the feeling of repugnance caused
among all people of sensibility and refinement by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
sight, or mention, or even thought, of the business of
the butcher is also largely on the increase; so that
the details of the revolting process are, as far as possible,
kept carefully out of sight and out of mind,
being delegated to a pariah class who do the work
which most educated persons would shrink from doing
for themselves. In these two facts we have clear
evidence, first that there is good reason why the public
conscience, or at any rate the humanitarian conscience,
should be uneasy concerning the slaughter of &#8220;live-stock,&#8221;
and secondly that this uneasiness is already to
a large extent developed and manifested.</p>

<p>The common argument, adopted by many apologists
of flesh-eating, as of fox-hunting, that the pain inflicted
by the death of the animals is more than compensated
by the pleasure enjoyed by them in their life-time,
since otherwise they would not have been brought
into existence at all, is ingenious rather than convincing,
being indeed none other than the old familiar
fallacy already commented on&mdash;the arbitrary trick of
constituting ourselves the spokesmen and the interpreters
of our victims. Mr. E. B. Nicholson, for
example, is of opinion that &#8220;we may pretty safely
take it that if he [the fox] were able to understand
and answer the question, he would choose life, with all
its pains and risks, to non-existence without them.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Unfortunately for the soundness of this suspiciously
partial assumption, there is no recorded instance of
this strange alternative having ever been submitted
either to fox or philosopher; so that a precedent has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
yet to be established on which to found a judgment.
Meantime, instead of committing the gross absurdity
of talking of non-existence as a state which is good,
or bad, or in any way comparable to existence, we
might do well to remember that animals&#8217; rights, if we
admit them at all, must begin with the birth, and can
only end with the death, of the animals in question,
and that we cannot evade our just responsibilities by
any such quibbling references to an imaginary ante-natal
choice in an imaginary ante-natal condition.</p>

<p>The most mischievous effect of the practice of flesh-eating,
in its influence on the study of animals&#8217; rights
at the present time, is that it so stultifies and debases
the very <i>raison d&#8217;&ecirc;tre</i> of countless myriads of beings&mdash;it
brings them into life for no better purpose than
to deny their right to live. It is idle to appeal to the
internecine warfare that we see in some aspects of
wild nature, where the weaker animal is often the prey
of the stronger, for there (apart from the fact that co-operation
largely modifies competition) the weaker
races at least live their own lives and take their
chance in the game, whereas the victims of the human
carnivora are bred, and fed, and from the first pre-destined
to untimely slaughter, so that their whole
mode of living is warped from its natural standard,
and they are scarcely more than animated beef or
mutton or pork. It has been well said that &#8220;to keep a
man (slave or servant) for your own advantage merely,
to keep an animal that you may <i>eat</i> it, is a lie. You
cannot look that man or animal in the face.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>Vegetarianism, then, is the ideal towards which
food-reformers must strive; and in the meantime
something may be done by the improvement of
methods of slaughtering. The advantages of the public
over the private slaughter-house have repeatedly
been demonstrated, as, for example, in the Report of
the Tuberculosis Commission of 1898, and in the
Report of the Commission appointed by the Admiralty
&#8220;to consider the humane slaughtering of
animals,&#8221; issued in 1904. Anyone who will compare
the blundering, haphazard methods of many English
slaughter-houses with the model abattoirs of Germany,
Switzerland, and other Continental States, will at
once see the pressing need of such reforms on the
score of humanity.</p>

<p>The butchers&#8217; objections to the abattoir system
arise from the usual trade prejudices, and from the
fear that their interests would suffer; but private
interests, real or imagined, should not be allowed to
stand in the way of a reform which would in the long
run benefit all classes of the community&mdash;not least
the unhappy victims of the shambles. One thing is
certain, that if all flesh-eaters could themselves see
what goes on behind the scenes in many private
slaughter-houses, an end would soon be put to a
system which is as barbarous as it is insanitary&mdash;a
fruitful cause of cruelty to the animals and of danger
to the public.</p>

<p>Reform of diet will doubtless be slow, and attended
in many individual cases with its difficulties and
drawbacks. But at least we may lay down this much
as incumbent on all humanitarian thinkers&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
everyone must satisfy himself of the necessity, the
real necessity, of the use of flesh-food, before he comes
to any conclusion on the subject of animals&#8217; rights.
It is easy to see that, as the question is more and
more discussed, the result will be more and more
decisive. &#8220;Whatever my own practice may be,&#8221; wrote
Thoreau, &#8220;I have no doubt that it is a part of the
destiny of the human race, in its gradual improvement,
to leave off eating animals, as surely as the
savage tribes have left off eating each other when they
came in contact with the more civilized.&#8221;</p>

<small>SPORT, OR AMATEUR BUTCHERY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> particular form of recreation which is euphemistically
known as &#8220;sport&#8221; has a close historical
connection with the practice of flesh-eating, inasmuch
as the hunter was in old times what the butcher is now,&mdash;the
&#8220;purveyor&#8221; on whom the family was dependent
for its daily supply of victuals. Modern sport, however,
as usually carried on in civilized European
countries, has degenerated into what has been well
described as &#8220;amateur butchery,&#8221; a system under
which the slaughter of certain kinds of animals is
practised less as a necessity than as a means of
amusement and diversion. Just as the youthful nobles,
during the savage scenes and reprisals of the Huguenot
wars, used to seize the opportunity of exercising their
swordsmanship, and perfecting themselves in the art
of dealing graceful death-blows, so the modern sportsman
converts the killing of animals from a prosaic
and perhaps distasteful business into an agreeable and
gentlemanly pastime.</p>

<p>Now, on the very face of it, this amateur butchery
is, in one sense, the most wanton and indefensible of
all possible violations of the principle of animals&#8217;
rights. If animals&mdash;or men, for that matter&mdash;have of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
necessity to be killed, let them be killed accordingly;
but to seek one&#8217;s own <i>amusement</i> out of the death-pangs
of other beings, this is saddening stupidity
indeed! Wisely did Wordsworth inculcate as the
moral of his &#8220;Hartleap Well,&#8221;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Never to blend our pleasure or our pride</div>
<div class="verse">With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>But the sporting instinct is due to sheer callousness
and insensibility; the sportsman, by force of habit, or
by force of hereditary influence, cannot understand or
sympathize with the sufferings he causes, and being,
in the great majority of instances, a man of slow perception,
he naturally finds it much easier to follow the
hounds than to follow an argument. And here, in his
chief blame, lies also his chief excuse; for it may be
said of him, as it cannot be said of certain other
tormentors, that he really does not comprehend the
import of what he is doing. Whether this ultimately
makes his position better or worse, is a point for the
casuist to decide.</p>

<p>That &#8220;it would have to be killed anyhow&#8221; is a truly
deplorable reason for torturing any animal whatsoever;
it is an argument which would equally have justified
the worst barbarities of the Roman amphitheatre. To
exterminate wolves, and other dangerous species, may
indeed, at certain places and times, be necessary and
justifiable enough. But the sportsman nowadays will
not even perform this practical service of exterminating
such animals&mdash;the fox, for example&mdash;as are noxious
to the general interests of the community; on the
contrary, he &#8220;preserves&#8221; them (note the unintended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
humour of the term!), and then, by a happy afterthought,
claims the gratitude of the animals themselves
for his humane and benevolent interposition.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In plain
words, he first undertakes to rid the country of a pest,
and then, finding the process an enjoyable one to
himself, he contrives that it shall never be brought to
a conclusion. Prometheus had precisely as much
reason to be grateful to the vulture for eternally
gnawing at his liver, as have the hunted animals to
thank the predaceous sportsmen who &#8220;preserve&#8221; them.
Let me once more enter a protest against the canting
Pharisaism which is afraid to take the just responsibility
of its own selfish pleasure-seeking.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;What name should we bestow,&#8221; said a humane essayist
of the eighteenth century,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> &#8220;on a superior being who, without
provocation or advantage, should continue from day to
day, void of all pity and remorse, to torment mankind for
diversion, and at the same time endeavour with the utmost
care to preserve their lives and to promulgate their species,
in order to increase the number of victims devoted to his
malevolence, and be delighted in proportion to the miseries
which he occasioned? I say, what name detestable enough
could we find for such a being? Yet, if we impartially
consider the case, and our intermediate situation, we must
acknowledge that, with regard to the inferior animals, just
such a being is the sportsman.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The excuses alleged in favour of English blood-sports<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
in general, and of hunting in particular, are for
the most part as irrelevant as they are unreasonable.
It is often said that the manliness of our national
character would be injuriously affected by the discontinuance
of these sports&mdash;a strange argument, when
one considers the very unequal, and therefore unmanly,
conditions of the strife. But, apart from this consideration,
what right can we possess to cultivate
these personal qualities at the expense of unspeakable
suffering to the lower races? Such actions may be
pardonable in a savage, or in a schoolboy in whom
the savage nature still largely predominates, but they
are wholly unworthy of a civilized and rational man.</p>

<p>As for the nonsense sometimes talked about the
beneficial effects of those field-sports which bring
men into contact with the sublimities of nature, the
dynamiters who used to cross the ocean to blow up
an English town might on this principle have justified
the object of their journey by the assertion that the
sea-voyage brought them in contact with the exalting
and ennobling influence of the Atlantic.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>As the case stands between the sportsman and his
victims, there cannot be much doubt as to whence the
benefits proceed, and from which party the gratitude
is due.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Woe to the ungrateful!&#8221; says Michelet. &#8220;By this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>phrase I mean the sporting crowd, who, unmindful of the
numerous benefits we owe to the animals, exterminate
innocent life. A terrible sentence weighs on the tribes of
sportsmen&mdash;they can create nothing. They originate no
art, no industry.... It is a shocking and hideous thing to
see a child partial to sport; to see woman enjoying and
admiring murder, and encouraging her child. That delicate
and sensitive woman would not give him a knife, but she
gives him a gun.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The sports of hunting and coursing are a brutality
which could not be tolerated for a day in a state which
possessed anything more than the mere name of justice,
freedom, and enlightenment. Sir Thomas More says
of his model citizens in &#8220;Utopia:&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Nor can they comprehend the pleasure of seeing dogs
run after a hare more than of seeing one dog run after
another; for if the seeing them run is that which gives the
pleasure, you have the same entertainment to the eye on
both these occasions, since that is the same in both cases;
but if the pleasure lies in seeing the hare killed and torn by
the dogs, this ought rather to stir pity, that a weak, harmless,
and fearful hare should be devoured by strong, fierce, and
cruel dogs.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>To be accurate, the zest of sport lies neither in the
running nor the killing, as such, but in the excitement
caused by the fact that a life (some one else&#8217;s life) is
at stake, that the pursuer is matched in a fierce game
of hazard against the pursued. The opinion has
been expressed, by one well qualified to speak with
authority on the subject, that &#8220;well-laid drags, tracked
by experts, would test the mettle both of hounds and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
riders to hounds; but then a terrified, palpitating, fleeing
life would not be struggling ahead, and so the idea
is not pleasing to those who find pleasure in blood.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The case is even worse when the quarry is to all
intents and purposes domesticated, an animal wild by
nature, but by force of circumstances and surroundings
tame. Such are the park deer, the victims of the sportsmen
who persist in carrying on the carted stag hunt,
in spite of the abolition of the Royal Buckhounds in
1901. There is urgent need that the laws which relate
to the humane treatment of animals should be amended,
or more wisely interpreted, on this particular point, so
as to afford immediate protection to these domesticated
stags, whose torture, under the name and sanction of
&#8220;sport,&#8221; has been long condemned by the public
conscience. Bear-baiting and cock-fighting have now
been abolished by legal enactment, and it is high
time that the equally demoralizing sport of hunting
of tame stags should be relegated to the same category.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The same must be said of some sports which are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>practised by the English working man&mdash;rabbit-coursing,
in particular, that half-holiday diversion which is
so popular in many villages of the North. An attempt
is often made by the apologists of amateur butchery
to play off one class against another in the discussion
of this question. They protest, on the one hand,
against any interference with aristocratic sport, on
the plea that working men are no less addicted to
such pastimes; and, on the other hand, a cry is raised
against the unfairness of restricting the amusements
of the poor, while noble lords and ladies are permitted
to hunt the carted stag with impunity.</p>

<p>The obvious answer to these quibbling excuses is
that <i>all</i> such barbarities, whether practised by rich or
poor, are alike condemned by any conceivable principle
of justice and humaneness; and, further, that it is a
doubtful compliment to working men to suggest that
they have nothing better to do in their spare hours
than to torture defenceless rabbits. It was long ago
remarked by Martin, the author of the famous Act of
1822, that such an argument indicates at bottom a
contempt rather than regard for the working-classes;
it is as much as to say, &#8220;Poor creatures, let them
alone&mdash;they have few amusements&mdash;let them enjoy
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing can be more shocking than the treatment
commonly accorded to rabbits, rats, and other small
animals, on the plea that they are &#8220;vermin,&#8221; and
therefore, it is tacitly assumed, outside the pale of
humanity and justice; we have here another instance
of the way in which the application of a contemptuous
name may aggravate and increase the actual tendency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
to barbarous ill-usage. How many a demoralizing
spectacle, especially where the young are concerned,
is witnessed when &#8220;fun&#8221; is made out of the death and
torture of &#8220;vermin&#8221;! How horrible is the practice,
apparently universal throughout all country districts,
of setting steel traps along the ditches and hedgerows,
in which the victims are frequently left to linger, in
an agony of pain and apprehension, for hours, or even
days! Yet there are no means of redressing these
barbarities, because the laws, such as they are, which
prohibit cruelty to animals, are not designed to take
any cognizance of &#8220;vermin.&#8221;</p>

<p>All that has been said of hunting and coursing is
applicable also&mdash;in a less degree, perhaps, but on
exactly the same principle&mdash;to the sports of shooting
and fishing. Let me quote a striking testimony to the
wickedness and injustice of sport, as exhibited in one
of its most refined and fashionable forms, the &#8220;cult of
the pheasant.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;For what is it but the deliberate massacre in cold blood
every year of thousands and tens of thousands of tame, hand-reared
birds who are literally driven into the jaws of death
and mown down in a peculiarly brutal manner?... A
perfect roar of guns fills the air, louder tap and yell the
beaters, above the din can be heard the heart-rending cries
of wounded hares and rabbits, some of which can be seen
dragging themselves away, with both hind legs broken, or
turning round and round in their agony before they die.
And the pheasants! They are on every side, some rising,
some dropping, some lying dead, but the greater majority
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>fluttering on the ground wounded, some with both legs broken
and a wing, some with both wings broken and a leg, others
merely winged, running to hide, others mortally wounded
gasping out their last breath of life amidst the fiendish sounds
which surround them. And this is called <i>sport</i>!... Sport
in every form and kind is horrible, from the rich man&#8217;s hare-coursing
to the poor man&#8217;s rabbit-coursing. All show the &#8216;tiger&#8217;
that lives in our natures, and which nothing but a higher
civilization will eradicate.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>It does not in the least matter, so far as the question
of animals&#8217; rights is concerned, whether you run your
victim to death with a pack of yelping hounds, or
shoot him with a gun, or drag him from his native
waters by a hook; the point at issue is simply whether
man is justified in inflicting any form of death or
suffering on the lower races for his mere amusement
and caprice. There can be little doubt what answer
must be given to this question.</p>

<small>MURDEROUS MILLINERY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have seen what a vast amount of quite preventable
suffering is caused through the agency of the
slaughterman who kills for a business, and of the
sportsman who kills for a pastime, the victims in either
case being regarded as mere irrational automata, with
no higher destiny than to satisfy the most artificial
wants or the most cruel caprices of mankind. A few
words must now be said about the fur and feather
traffic&mdash;the slaughter of mammals and birds for human
clothing or human ornamentation&mdash;a subject connected
on the one hand with that of flesh-eating, and on the
other, though to a less degree, with that of sport.
What I shall say will of course have no reference to
wool, or any other substance which is obtainable without
injury to the animal from whom it is taken.</p>

<p>It is evident that in this case, as in the butchering
trade, the responsibility for whatever wrongs are done
must rest ultimately on the class which demands an
unnecessary commodity, rather than on that which is
compelled by economic pressure to supply it; it is not
the man who kills the bird, but the lady who wears
the feathers in her hat, who is the true offender. But
here it will be asked, <i>is</i> the use of furs and feathers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
unnecessary? Now of course if we consider solely
the present needs and tastes of society, in regard to
these matters, it must be admitted that a sudden, unexpected
withdrawal of the numberless animal products
on which our &#8220;civilization&#8221; depends would
be a very serious embarrassment; the world, as
alarmists point out to us, might have to go to bed
without candles, and wake up to find itself without
boots. It must be remembered, however, that such
changes do not come about with suddenness, but, on
the contrary, with the extremest slowness imaginable;
and a little thought will suggest, what experience has
already in many cases confirmed, that there is really
no indispensable animal substance for which a substitute
cannot be provided, when once there is sufficient
demand, from the vegetable or mineral kingdom.</p>

<p>Take the case of leather, for instance, a material
which is in almost universal use, and may, under
present circumstances, be fairly described as a necessary.
What should we do without leather? was, in
fact, a question very frequently asked of vegetarians
during the early and callow years of the food-reform
movement, until it was found that vegetable leather
could be successfully employed in boot-making, and
that the inconsistency of which vegetarians at present
stand convicted is only a temporary and incidental
one. Now of course so long as oxen are slaughtered
for food, their skins will be utilized in this way; but
it is not difficult to foresee that the gradual discontinuance
of the habit of flesh-eating will lead to a
similar gradual discontinuance of the use of hides, and
that human ingenuity will not be at a loss in the provision<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
of a substitute. So that it does not follow that
a commodity which, in the immediate sense, is necessary
now, would be absolutely or permanently necessary,
under different conditions, in the future.</p>

<p>My sole reason for dwelling on this typical point is
that I wish to guard myself, by anticipation, against
a very plausible argument, by which discredit is often
cast on the whole theory of animals&#8217; rights. What
can be the object, it is said, of entering on the sentimental
path of an impossible humanitarianism, which
only leads into insurmountable difficulties and dilemmas,
inasmuch as the use of these various animal substances
is so interwoven with the whole system of
society that it can never be discontinued until society
itself comes to an end? I assert that the case is by
no means so desperate&mdash;that it is easy to make a right
beginning now, and to foresee the lines along which
future progress will be effected. Much that is impossible
in our own time may be realized, by those who
come after us, as the natural and inevitable outcome
of reforms which it now lies with us to inaugurate.</p>

<p>This said, it may be freely admitted that, at the
outset, humanitarians will do well to draw a practical
distinction between such animal products as are converted
to some genuine personal use, and those which
are supplied for no better object than to gratify the
idle whims of luxury or fashion. The <i>when</i> and the
<i>where</i> are considerations of the greatest import in these
questions. There is a certain fitness in the hunter&mdash;himself
the product of a rough, wild era in human
development&mdash;assuming the skins of the wild creatures
he has conquered; but it does not follow because an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
Eskimo, for example, may appropriately wear fur, or
a Red Indian feathers, that this apparel will be equally
becoming to the inhabitants of London or New York;
on the contrary, an act which is perfectly natural in
the one case is often a sign of crass vulgarity in the
other. Hercules, clothed triumphant in the spoils of
the Nemean lion, is a subject for painter and poet;
but what if he had purchased the skin, ready dressed,
from a contemporary manufacturer?</p>

<p>What we must unhesitatingly condemn is the blind
and reckless barbarism which has ransacked, and is
ransacking, whole provinces and continents, without a
glimmer of suspicion that the birds and quadrupeds
which it is rapidly exterminating have any other part
or purpose in nature than to be sacrificed to human
vanity, that idle gentlemen and ladies may bedeck
themselves, like certain characters in the fable, in
borrowed skins and feathers. What care <i>they</i> for all
the beauty and tenderness and intelligence of the
varied forms of animal life? and what is it to them
whether these be helped forward by man in the universal
progress and evolution of all living things, or
whether whole species be transformed and degraded
by the way&mdash;boiled down, like the beaver, into a hat,
or, like the seal, into a lady&#8217;s jacket?</p>

<p>Whatever it may be in other respects, the fur trade,
in so far as it is a supply of ornamental clothing for
those who are under no necessity of wearing fur at all,
is a barbarous and stupid business. It makes patchwork,
one may say, not only of the hides of its victims,
but of the conscience and intellect of its patrons. A
fur garment or trimming, we are told, appearing to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
eye as if it were one uniform piece, is generally made
up of many curiously shaped fragments. It is significant
that a society which is enamoured of so many
shams and fictions, and which detests nothing so
strongly as the need of looking facts in the face,
should pre-eminently esteem those articles of apparel
which are constructed on the most deceptive and illusory
principle. The story of the Ass in the Lion&#8217;s
skin is capable, it seems, of a new and wider application.</p>

<p>Cruel as is all hunting of animals for their fur,
there is a peculiar callousness in the seal &#8220;fishery,&#8221;
not only because the seal, far from being a fish, is
one of the most sensitive of warm-blooded animals,
but because of the atrocious methods by which the
practice of &#8220;sealing&#8221; has too often been pursued.
In all the history of man&#8217;s dealings with the lower
races, there is no bloodier record than that of his
treatment of the trustful and unresisting seal.</p>

<p>But if the fur trade gives cause for serious reflection,
what are we to say of the still more abominable trade
in feathers? Murderous, indeed, is the millinery
which finds its most fashionable ornament in the dead
bodies of birds&mdash;birds, the loveliest and most blithesome
beings in Nature! It has been said that &#8220;to
enumerate all the feathers used for ornamental purposes
would be practically to give a complete list
of all known and obtainable birds.&#8221; The figures
and details published by those humane writers who
have raised an unavailing protest against this latest
and worst crime of Fashion are really appalling in
their stern and naked record of unremitting cruelty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;One dealer in London is said to have received as a
single consignment 32,000 dead humming-birds, 80,000
aquatic birds, and 800,000 pairs of wings. A Parisian
dealer had a contract for 40,000 birds, and an army of
murderers were turned out to supply the order. No less
than 40,000 terns have been sent from Long Island in one
season for millinery purposes. At one auction alone in
London there were sold 404,389 West Indian and Brazilian
bird-skins, and 356,389 East Indian, besides thousands of
pheasants and birds-of-paradise.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The meaning of such statistics is simply that the
women of Europe and America have given an order
for the ruthless extermination of birds.</p>

<p>It is not seriously contended in any quarter that
this wholesale destruction, effected often in the most
revolting and heartless manner, is capable of excuse
or justification; yet the efforts of those who address
themselves to the better feelings of the offenders
appear to meet with little or no success. The cause
of this failure must undoubtedly be sought in the
general lack of any clear conviction that animals have
rights; and the evil will never be thoroughly remedied
until not only this particular abuse, but all such abuses,
and the prime source from which such abuses originate,
have been subjected to an impartial criticism.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>In saying this I do not of course mean to imply
that special efforts should not be directed against
special cruelties. I have already remarked that the
main responsibility for the daily murders which fashionable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
millinery is instigating must lie at the door of
those who demand, rather than those who supply,
these hideous and funereal ornaments. Unfortunately
the process, like that of slaughtering cattle, is throughout
delegated to other hands than those of the ultimate
purchaser, so that it is exceedingly difficult to bring
home a due sense of blood-guiltiness to the right
person.</p>

<p>The confirmed sportsman, or amateur butcher, at
least sees with his own eyes the circumstances attendant
on his &#8220;sport&#8221;; and the fact that he feels no compunction
in pursuing it is due, in most cases, to an
obtuseness or confusion of the moral faculties. But
many of those who wear seal-skin mantles, or feather-bedaubed
bonnets are naturally humane enough; they
are misled by pure ignorance or thoughtlessness, and
would at once abandon such practices if they could
be made aware of the methods employed in the wholesale
massacre of seals or humming-birds. Still, it
remains true that all these questions ultimately hang
together, and that no complete solution will be found
for any one of them until the whole problem of our
moral relation towards the lower animals is studied
with far greater comprehensiveness.</p>

<p>For this reason it is perhaps unscientific to assert
that any particular form of cruelty to animals is <i>worse</i>
than another form; the truth is, that each of these
hydra-heads, the offspring of one parent stem, has its
own proper characteristic, and is different, not worse
or better than the rest. To flesh-eating belongs the
proud distinction of causing a greater bulk of
animal suffering than any other habit whatsoever; to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
sport, the meed of unique and unparalleled brutality;
while the patrons of murderous millinery afford the
most marvellous instance of the capacity the human
mind possesses for ignoring its personal responsibilities.
To re-apply Keats&#8217;s words:</p>

<small>EXPERIMENTAL TORTURE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Great</span> is the change when we turn from the easy,
thoughtless indifferentism of the sportsman or the
milliner to the more determined and deliberately
chosen attitude of the scientist&mdash;so great, indeed, that
by many people, even among professed champions of
animals&#8217; rights, it is held impossible to trace such dissimilar
lines of action to one and the same source.
Yet it can be shown, I think, that in this instance, as
in those already examined, the prime cause of man&#8217;s
injustice to the lower animals is the belief that they
are mere automata, devoid alike of spirit, character,
and individuality; only, while the ignorant sportsman
expresses this contempt through the medium of the
battue, and the milliner through that of the bonnet,
the more seriously-minded physiologist works his work
in the &#8220;experimental torture&#8221; of the laboratory. The
difference lies in the temperament of the men, and in
the tone of their profession; but in their denial of the
most elementary rights of the lower races, they are all
inspired and instigated by one common prejudice.</p>

<p>The analytical method employed by modern science
tends ultimately, in the hands of its most enlightened
exponents, to a recognition of the close relationship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
between mankind and the animals; but incidentally
it has exercised a most sinister effect on the study of
the <i>jus animalium</i> among the mass of average men.
For consider the dealings of the so-called naturalist
with the animals whose nature he makes it his business
to observe! In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, he
is wholly unappreciative of the distinctive quality, the
individuality, of the subject of his investigations, and
becomes nothing more than a contented accumulator
of facts, an industrious dissector of carcasses.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I think the most important requisite in describing an
animal,&#8221; says Thoreau, &#8220;is to be sure that you give its
character and spirit, for in that you have, without error, the
sum and effect of all its parts known and unknown. Surely
the most important part of an animal is its <i>anima</i>, its vital
spirit, on which is based its character and all the particulars
by which it most concerns us. Yet most scientific books
which treat of animals leave this out altogether, and what
they describe are, as it were, phenomena of dead matter.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The whole system of our &#8220;natural history&#8221; as
practised at the present time, is based on a deplorably
partial and misleading method. Does a rare bird
alight on our shores? It is at once slaughtered by
some enterprising collector, and proudly handed over
to the nearest taxidermist, that it may be &#8220;preserved,&#8221;
among a number of other stuffed corpses, in the local
Museum. It is a dismal business at best, this science
of the fowling-piece and the dissecting-knife, but it is
in keeping with the utilitarian tendency of a certain
school of thought, and only a few of its professors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
rise out of it, and above it, to a maturer and more far-sighted
understanding.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The child,&#8221; says Michelet, &#8220;disports himself, shatters,
and destroys; he finds his happiness in <i>undoing</i>. And
science, in its childhood, does the same. It cannot study
unless it kills. The sole use which it makes of a living
mind is, in the first place, to dissect it. None carry into
scientific pursuits that tender reverence for life which Nature
rewards by unveiling to us her mysteries.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Under these circumstances, it is scarcely to be
wondered at that modern scientists, their minds athirst
for further and further opportunities of satisfying this
analytical curiosity, should desire to have recourse to
the experimental torture which is euphemistically described
as &#8220;vivisection.&#8221; They are caught and impelled
by the overmastering passion of knowledge;
and, as a handy subject for the gratification of this
passion, they see before them the helpless race of
animals, in part wild, in part domesticated, but alike
regarded by the generality of mankind as incapable
of possessing any &#8220;rights.&#8221; They are practically
accustomed (despite their ostensible disavowal of the
Cartesian theory) to treat these animals as automata&mdash;things
made to be killed and dissected and catalogued
for the advancement of knowledge; they are,
moreover, in their professional capacity, the lineal
descendants of a class of men who, however kindly
and considerate in other respects, have never scrupled
to subordinate the strongest promptings of humaneness
to the least of the supposed interests of science.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>Given these conditions, it seems as inevitable that the
physiologist should vivisect as that the country gentleman
should shoot. Experimental torture is as appropriately
the study of the half-enlightened man as sport
is the amusement of the half-witted.</p>

<p>But the fact that vivisection is not, as some of its
opponents would appear to regard it, a portentous, unaccountable
phenomenon, but rather the logical outcome
of a certain ill-balanced habit of mind, does not
in any way detract from its intellectual and moral
loathsomeness. It is idle to spend a single moment
in advocating the rights of the lower animals, if such
rights do not include a total and unqualified exemption
from the awful tortures of vivisection&mdash;from the doom
of being slowly and mercilessly dismembered, or flayed,
or baked alive, or infected with some deadly virus, or
subjected to any of the numerous modes of torture inflicted
by the Scientific Inquisition.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Let us heartily
endorse the words of Miss Cobbe on this crucial
subject:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The <i>minimum</i> of all possible rights plainly is&mdash;to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
spared the worst of all possible wrongs; and if a horse or
dog have no claim to be spared from being maddened and
mangled after the fashion of Pasteur and Chauveau, then it
is impossible it can have any right at all, or that any offence
against it, by gentle or simple, can deserve punishment.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The assertion, commonly made by the apologists of
the Scientific Inquisition, that vivisection is justified
by its utility&mdash;that it is, in fact, indispensable to the
advance of knowledge and civilization&mdash;is founded on
a mere half-view of the position; the scientist, as I
have already remarked, is a half-enlightened man.
Let us assume (a large assumption, certainly, controverted
as it is by some most weighty medical testimony)
that the progress of surgical science is assisted
by the experiments of the vivisector. What then?
Before rushing to the conclusion that vivisection is
justifiable on that account, a wise man will take into
full consideration the other, the moral side of the
question&mdash;the hideous injustice of torturing a sentient
animal, and the terrible wrong thereby done to the
humane sense of the community.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The wise scientist and the wise humanist are
identical. A true science cannot possibly ignore the
incontrovertible fact that the practice of vivisection is
revolting to the human conscience, even among the
ordinary members of a not over-sensitive society.
The so-called &#8220;science&#8221; which overlooks this vital
fact, and confines its view to the material aspects of
the problem, is not science at all, but a one-sided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
assertion of the views which find favour with a particular
class of specialists.</p>

<p>Nothing is necessary which is abhorrent, revolting,
intolerable, to the general instincts of humanity.
Better a thousand times that science should forego or
postpone the questionable advantage of certain problematical
discoveries, than that the moral conscience
of the community should be unmistakably outraged
by the confusion of right and wrong. The short cut is
not always the right path; and to perpetrate a cruel
injustice to the lower animals, and then attempt to
excuse it on the ground that it will benefit posterity,
is an argument which is as irrelevant as it is immoral.
Ingenious it may be (in the way of hoodwinking the
unwary) but it is certainly in no true sense scientific.</p>

<p>If there be one bright spot, one refreshing oasis, in
the discussion of this dreary subject, it is the humorous
recurrence of the old threadbare fallacy of &#8220;better
for the animals themselves.&#8221; Yes, even here, in the
laboratory of the vivisector, amidst the baking and
sawing and dissection, we are sometimes met by that
familiar friend&mdash;the proud plea of a single-hearted
regard for the interests of the suffering animals! Who
knows but what some beneficent experimentalist, if
only he be permitted to cut up a sufficient number of
victims, may discover some potent remedy for all the
lamented ills of the animal as well as of the human
creation? Can we doubt that the victims themselves,
if once they could realize the noble object of their
martyrdom, would vie with each other in rushing
eagerly on the knife? The only marvel is that, where
the cause is so meritorious, no <i>human</i> volunteer has as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
yet come forward to die under the hands of the vivisector!<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>It is fully admitted that experiments on men would
be far more valuable and conclusive than experiments
on animals; yet scientists usually disavow any wish
to revive these practices, and indignantly deny the
rumours, occasionally circulated, that the poorer
patients in hospitals are the subjects of such anatomical
curiosity. Now here, it will be observed, in the
case of men, the <i>moral</i> aspect of vivisection is admitted
by the scientist as a matter of course, yet in the case
of animals it is allowed no weight whatever! How
can this strange inconsistency be justified, unless on
the assumption that men have rights, but animals
have no rights&mdash;in other words, that animals are mere
<i>things</i>, possessed of no claim on the justice and forbearance
of the community?</p>

<p>One of the most notable and ominous features in
the apologies offered for vivisection is the assertion, so
commonly made by scientific writers, that it is &#8220;no
worse&#8221; than certain kindred practices. When the upholders
of any accused institution begin to plead that
it is &#8220;no worse&#8221; than other institutions, we may feel
quite assured that the case is a very bad one indeed&mdash;it
is the drowning man catching at the last straw
and shred of argument. Thus the advocates of experimental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
torture are reduced to the expedient of
laying stress on the cruelties of the butcher and the
herdsman, and inquiring why, if pole-axing and castration
are permissible, vivisection may not also be
permitted.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Sport, also, is a practice which has greatly
shocked the susceptibilities of the humane vivisector.
A writer in the &#8220;Fortnightly Review&#8221; has defined
sport as &#8220;the love of the clever destruction of living
things,&#8221; and has calculated that three millions of
animals are yearly mangled by English sportsmen, in
addition to those killed outright.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Now if the attack on vivisection emanated primarily
or wholly from the apologists of the sportsman and
slaughterer, this <i>tu quoque</i> of the scientist&#8217;s must be
allowed to be a smart, though rather flippant, retort;
but when <i>all</i> cruelty is arraigned as inhuman and unjustifiable,
an evasive answer of this kind ceases to
have any pertinence. Let us admit, however, that, in
contrast with the childish brutality of the sportsman,
the undoubted seriousness and conscientiousness of
the vivisector (for I do not question that he acts from
conscientious motives) may be counted to his advantage.
But then we have to remember, on the other
hand, that the conscientious man, when he goes wrong,
is far more dangerous to society than the knave or the
fool; indeed, the special horror of vivisection consists
precisely in this fact, that it is not due to mere
thoughtlessness and ignorance, but represents a deliberate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
avowed, conscientious invasion of the very
principle of animals&#8217; rights.</p>

<p>I have already said that it is idle to speculate which
is the worst form of cruelty to animals, for certainly
in this subject, if anywhere, we must</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent6">&#8220;... reject the lore</div>
<div class="verse">Of nicely calculated less or more.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Vivisection, if there be any truth at all in the principle
for which I am contending, is not the root, but the
flower and consummation of barbarity and injustice&mdash;the
<i>ne plus ultra</i> of iniquity in man&#8217;s dealings with the
lower races. The root of the evil lies, as I have throughout
asserted, in that detestable assumption (detestable
equally whether it be based on pseudo-religious or
pseudo-scientific grounds) that there is a gulf, an
impassable barrier, between man and the animals, and
that the moral instincts of compassion, justice, and
love, are to be as sedulously repressed and thwarted
in the one direction as they are to be fostered and
extended in the other.</p>

<p>For this very reason our crusade against the Scientific
Inquisition, to be thorough and successful, must
be founded on the rock of consistent opposition to
cruelty in every form and phase; it is useless to
denounce vivisection as the source of all inhumanities,
and, while demanding its immediate suppression, to
suppose that other minor questions may be indefinitely
postponed. It is true that the actual emancipation of
the lower races, as of the human, can only proceed
step by step, and that it is both natural and politic to
strike first at what is most repulsive to the public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
conscience. I am not denying the wisdom of such a
concentration of effort on any particular point, but
warning my readers against the too common tendency
to forget the general principle that underlies each
individual protest.</p>

<p>The spirit in which we approach these matters
should be a liberal and far-seeing one. Those who
work for the abolition of vivisection, or any other
particular wrong, should do so with the avowed purpose
of capturing one stronghold of the enemy, not
because they believe that the war will then be over,
but because they will be able to use the position thus
gained as an advantageous starting-point for still
further progression.</p>

<small>LINES OF REFORM.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> now applied the principle with which we
started to the several cases where it appears to be
most flagrantly overlooked, we are in a better position
to estimate the difficulties and the possibilities of its
future acceptance. Our investigation of animals&#8217;
rights has necessarily been, in large measure, an
enumeration of animals&#8217; wrongs, a story of cruelty
and injustice which might have been unfolded in far
greater and more impressive detail, had there been
any reason for here repeating what has been elsewhere
established by other writers beyond doubt or dispute.</p>

<p>But my main purpose was to deal with a general
principle rather than with particular instances; and
enough has already been said to show that, while man
has much cause to be grateful to the lower animals for
the innumerable services rendered by them, he can
hardly pride himself on the record of the counter-benefits
which they have received at his hands.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;If we consider,&#8221; says Primatt, &#8220;the excruciating injuries
offered on our part to the brutes, and the patience on their
part; how frequent <i>our</i> provocation, and how seldom <i>their</i>
resentment (and in some cases <i>our</i> weakness and <i>their</i>
strength, <i>our</i> slowness and <i>their</i> swiftness); one would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
almost tempted to suppose that the brutes had combined in
one general scheme of benevolence, to teach mankind
lessons of mercy and meekness by their own forbearance
and longsuffering.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>It is unwise, no doubt, to dwell too exclusively on
the wrongs of which animals are the victims; it is still
more unwise to ignore them as they are to-day ignored
by the large majority of mankind. It is full time that
this question were examined in the light of some
rational and guiding principle, and that we ceased to
drift helplessly between the extremes of total indifference
on the one hand, and spasmodic, partially-applied
compassion on the other. We have had enough, and
too much, of trifling with this or that isolated aspect
of the subject, and of playing off the exposure of
somebody else&#8217;s insensibility by way of a balance for
our own, as if a <i>tu quoque</i> were a sufficient justification
of a man&#8217;s moral delinquencies.</p>

<p>The terrible sufferings that are quite needlessly inflicted
on the lower animals under the plea of domestic
usage, food-demands, sport, fashion, and science, are
patent to all who have the seeing eye and the feeling
heart to apprehend them; those sufferings will not be
lessened, nor will man&#8217;s responsibility be diminished
by any such irrelevant assertions as that vivisection is
less cruel than sport, or sport less cruel than butchering,&mdash;nor
yet by the contrary contention that vivisection,
or sport, or flesh-eating, as the case may be, is
the prime origin of all human inhumanity. We want
a comprehensive principle which will cover all these
varying instances, and determine the true lines of
reform.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>Such a principle, as I have throughout insisted, can
only be found in the recognition of the right of
animals, as of men, to be exempt from any unnecessary
suffering or serfdom, the right to live a
natural life of &#8220;restricted freedom,&#8221; subject to the real,
not supposed or pretended, requirements of the general
community. It may be said, and with truth, that the
perilous vagueness of the word &#8220;necessary&#8221; must
leave a convenient loop-hole of escape to anyone who
wishes to justify his own treatment of animals, however
unjustifiable that treatment may appear; the
vivisector will assert that his practice is necessary in
the interests of science, the flesh-eater that he cannot
maintain his health without animal food, and so on
through the whole category of systematic oppression.</p>

<p>The difficulty is an inevitable one. No form of
words can be devised for the expression of rights,
human or animal, which is not liable to some sort of
evasion; and all that can be done is to fix the responsibility
of deciding between what is necessary and
unnecessary, between factitious personal wants and
genuine social demands, on those in whom is vested
the power of exacting the service or sacrifice required.
The appeal being thus made, and the issue thus stated,
it may be confidently trusted that the personal conscience
of individuals and the public conscience of the
nation, acting and reacting in turn on each other, will
slowly and surely work out the only possible solution
of this difficult and many-sided problem.</p>

<p>For that the difficulties involved in this animal
question are many and serious, no one, I imagine,
would dispute, and certainly no attempt has been made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
in this essay to minimize or deny them. It may suit
the purpose of those who would retard all humanitarian
progress to represent its advocates as mere dreamers
and sentimentalists&mdash;men and women who befool
themselves by shutting their eyes to the fierce struggle
that is everywhere being waged in the world of nature,
while they point with virtuous indignation to the
iniquities perpetrated by man. But it is possible to
be quite free from any sentimental illusions, and yet
to hold a very firm belief in the principle of animals&#8217;
rights. We do not deny, or attempt to explain away,
the existence of evil in nature, or the fact that the life
of the lower races, as of mankind, is based to a large
degree on rapine and violence; nor can we pretend to
say whether this evil will ever be wholly amended. It
is therefore confessedly impossible, at the present
time, to formulate an entirely and logically consistent
philosophy of rights; but that would be a poor argument
against grappling with the subject at all.</p>

<p>Nor are the hard unmistakable facts of the situation,
when viewed in their entirety, by any means calculated
to inspire with confidence the opponents of humane
reform. For, if it be true that internecine competition
is a great factor in the economy of nature, it is no less
true, as has been already pointed out, that co-operation
is also a great factor therein. Furthermore, though
there are many difficulties besetting the onward path
of humanitarianism, an even greater difficulty has to
be faced by those who refuse to proceed along that
path, viz., the fact&mdash;a stronger fact than any that can
be produced on the other side&mdash;that the instinct of
compassion and justice to the lower animals has already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
been so largely developed in the human conscience as
to obtain legislative recognition. If the theory of
animals&#8217; rights is a mere idealistic phantasy, it follows
that we have long ago committed ourselves to a track
which can lead us nowhither. Is it then proposed
that we should retrace our steps, with a view to regaining
the antique position of savage and consistent
callousness; or are we to remain perpetually in our
present meaningless attitude, admitting the moral
value of a partially awakened sensibility, yet opposing
an eternal <i>non possumus</i> to any further improvement?
Neither of these alternatives is for a moment conceivable;
it is perfectly certain that there will still be a
forward movement, and along the same lines as in the
past.</p>

<p>Nor need we be at all disconcerted by the derisive
inquiries of our antagonists as to the final outcome of
such theories. &#8220;There is some reason to hope,&#8221; said
the author of the ironical &#8220;Vindication of the Rights
of Brutes,&#8221; &#8220;that this essay will soon be followed by
treatises on the rights of vegetables and minerals, and
that thus the doctrine of perfect equality will become
universal.&#8221; To which suggestion we need only answer,
&#8220;Perhaps.&#8221; It is for each age to initiate its own
ethical reforms, according to the light and sensibility
of its own instincts; further and more abstruse
questions, at present insoluble, may safely be left to
the more mature judgment of posterity. The human
conscience furnishes the safest and simplest indicator
in these matters. We know that certain acts of injustice
affect us as they did not affect our forefathers&mdash;it
is our duty to set these right. It is not our duty to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
agitate problems, which, at the present date, excite no
unmistakable moral feeling.</p>

<p>The humane instinct will assuredly continue to develop.
And it should be observed that to advocate
the rights of animals is far more than to plead for
compassion or justice towards the victims of ill-usage;
it is not only, and not primarily, for the sake of the
victims that we plead, but for the sake of mankind
itself. Our true civilization, our race-progress, our
<i>humanity</i> (in the best sense of the term) are concerned
in this development; it is ourselves, our own vital
instincts, that we wrong, when we trample on the
rights of the fellow-beings, human or non-human, over
whom we chance to hold jurisdiction.</p>

<p>This most important point is constantly overlooked
by the opponents of humanitarian reform. They
labour, unsuccessfully enough, to minimize the complaints
of animals&#8217; wrongs, on the plea that these
wrongs, though great, are not so great as they are
represented to be, and that in any case it is not possible,
or not urgently desirable, for man to alleviate them.
As if <i>human</i> interests also were not intimately bound
up in every such compassionate endeavour!</p>

<p>And this brings us back to the moral of the whole
matter. The idea of Humanity is no longer confined
to man; it is beginning to extend itself to the lower
animals, as in the past it has been gradually extended
to savages and slaves. &#8220;Behold the animals. There
is not one but the human soul lurks within it, fulfilling
its destiny as surely as within you.&#8221; So writes the
author of &#8220;Towards Democracy&#8221;; and what has long
been felt by the poet is now being scientifically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
corroborated by the anthropologist and philosopher.
&#8220;The standpoint of modern thought,&#8221; says B&uuml;chner,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
&#8220;no longer recognizes in animals a difference of kind,
but only a difference of degree, and sees the principle
of intelligence developing through an endless and unbroken
series.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that, on this point, evolutionary
science finds itself in agreement with oriental tradition.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The doctrine of metempsychosis,&#8221; says Strauss,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> &#8220;knits
men and beasts together here [in the East], and unites the
whole of Nature in one sacred and mysterious bond. The
breach between the two was opened in the first place by
Judaism, with its hatred of the Gods of Nature, next by the
dualism of Christianity. It is remarkable that at present a
deeper sympathy with the animal world should have arisen
among the more civilized nations, which manifests itself here
and there in societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals.
It is thus apparent that what on the one hand is the product
of modern science&mdash;the giving up of the spiritualistic isolation
of man from Nature&mdash;reveals itself simultaneously through
the channel of popular sentiment.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The true scientist and humanist is he who will
reconcile brain to heart, and show us how, without
any sacrifice of what we have gained in knowledge,
we may resume what we have temporarily lost during
the process of acquiring that knowledge&mdash;the sureness
of intuitive faculty which is originally implanted in
men and animals alike. Only by this return to the
common fount of feeling will it be possible for man to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
place himself in right relationship towards the lower
animals, and to break down the fatal barrier of antipathy
that he has himself erected.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> If we contrast
the mental and moral attitude of the generality of
mankind towards the lower races with that of such
men as St. Francis or Thoreau, we see what far-reaching
possibilities still lie before us on this line
of development.</p>

<p>A not altogether unjustifiable complaint is made
against &#8220;lovers of animals,&#8221; that they are often indifferent
to the struggle for human rights, while they
concern themselves so eagerly over the interests of the
lower races. Equally true is the converse statement,
that many earnest reformers and philanthropists, men
who have a genuine passion for human liberty and
progress, are coldly sceptical or even bitterly hostile
on the subject of the rights of animals. This organic
limitation of sympathies must be recognized and regretted,
but it is worse than useless for the one class
of reformers to indulge in blame or recrimination
against the other. It is certain that they are both
working towards the same ultimate end; and if they
cannot actually co-operate, they may at least refrain
from unnecessarily thwarting and opposing each other.</p>

<p>The principles of justice, if they are to make solid
and permanent headway, must be applied with
thoroughness and consistency. If there are rights of
animals, there must <i>&agrave; fortiori</i> be rights of men; and,
as I have shown, it is impossible to maintain that an
admission of human rights does not involve an admission<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
of animals&#8217; rights also. Now it may not
always fall to the lot of the same persons to advocate
both kinds of rights, but these rights are, nevertheless,
being simultaneously and concurrently advocated;
and those who are in a position to take a clear and
wide survey of the whole humanitarian movement are
aware that its final success is dependent on this broad
onward tendency.</p>

<p>The advent of democracy, imperfect though any democracy
must be which does not embrace all sentient
beings within its scope, will be of enormous assistance
to the cause of animals&#8217; rights, for under the present
unequal and inequitable social system there is no
possibility of those claims receiving their due share of
attention. In the rush and hurry of a competitive
society, where commercial profit is avowed to be the
main object of work, and where the well-being of men
and women is ruthlessly sacrificed to that object, what
likelihood is there that the lower animals will not be
used with a sole regard to the same predominant purpose?
Humane individuals may here and there protest,
and the growing conscience of the public may
express itself in legislation against the worst forms of
palpable ill-usage, but the bulk of the people simply
cannot, and will not, treat animals as they ought to
be treated. Do the wealthy classes show any such
consideration? Let &#8220;amateur butchery&#8221; and &#8220;murderous
millinery&#8221; be the answer. Can it be wondered,
then, that the &#8220;lower classes,&#8221; whose own rights
are existent far more in theory than in fact, should
exhibit a feeling of stolid indifference to the rights of
the still lower animals? It is to democracy, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
democratic sense of kinship and brotherhood, extending
first to mankind, and then to the lower races, that
we must look for future progress. The emancipation
of men will bring with it another and still wider emancipation&mdash;of
animals.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>In conclusion, we are brought face to face with this
practical problem&mdash;by what means can we best provide
for the attainment of the end we have in view? What
are the surest remedies for the present wrongs, and
the surest pledges for the future rights, of the victims
of human tyranny? There are two pre-eminently important
methods, which are sometimes regarded as
contradictory in principle, but which, as I hope to
show, are not only quite compatible, but even mutually
serviceable and to some degree inter-dependent. We
have no choice but to work by one or the other of
these methods, and, if we are wise, we shall endeavour
to work by both simultaneously, using the first as our
chief instrument of reform, the second as an auxiliary.</p>

<p>I. Education, in the largest sense of the term, has
always been, and must always remain, the indispensable
condition of humanitarian progress. Very excellent
are the words of John Bright on the subject:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Humanity to animals is a great point. If I were a
teacher in a school, I would make it a very important part
of my business to impress every boy and girl with the duty
of his or her being kind to all animals. It is impossible to
say how much suffering there is in the world from the barbarity
or unkindness which people show to what we call the
inferior creatures.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>It may be doubted, however, whether the young
will ever be specially impressed with the lesson of
humanity as long as the general tone of their elders
and instructors is one of cynical indifference, if not of
absolute hostility, to the recognition of animals&#8217; rights.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
It is society as a whole, and not one class in particular,
that needs enlightenment and remonstrance; in fact,
the very conception and scope of what is known as a
&#8220;liberal education&#8221; must be revolutionized and extended.
For if we find fault with the narrow and unscientific
spirit of what is known as &#8220;science,&#8221; we must
in fairness admit that our academic &#8220;humanities,&#8221; the
<i>liter&aelig; humaniores</i> of colleges and schools, together
with much of our modern culture and refinement, are
scarcely less deficient in the spirit of sympathy and
brotherhood. This divorce of &#8220;humanism&#8221; from
humaneness is one of the subtlest dangers by which
society is beset; for, if we grant that love needs to be
tempered and directed by wisdom, still more needful
is it that wisdom should be informed and vitalized by
love.</p>

<p>It is therefore not only our children who need to be
educated in the proper treatment of animals, but our
scientists, our religionists, our moralists, and our men
of letters. For, in spite of the great progress of humanitarian
ideas during the past century, it must be confessed
that the popular exponents of western thought
are still for the most part quite unable to appreciate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
the profound truth of those words of Rousseau, which
should form the basis of an enlightened system of instruction:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Hommes, soyez humains! C&#8217;est votre premier devoir.
Quelle sagesse y a-t-il pour vous, hors de l&#8217;humanit&eacute;?&#8221;</p></div>

<p>But how is this vast educational change to be inaugurated?
Like all far-reaching reforms which are
promoted by a few believers in the face of the public
indifference, it can only be carried through by the
energy and resolution of its supporters. The efforts
which the various humane societies are now making in
special directions, each concentrating its attack on a
particular abuse, must be supplemented and strengthened
by a crusade&mdash;an intellectual, literary, and social
crusade&mdash;against the central cause of oppression, viz.:
the disregard of the natural kinship between man and
the animals, and the consequent denial of their rights.
We must insist on having the whole question fully
considered and candidly discussed, and must no longer
permit its most important issues to be shirked because
it does not suit the convenience or the prejudices of
comfortable folk to give attention to them.</p>

<p>Above all, the sense of ridicule that at present
attaches to the supposed &#8220;sentimentalism&#8221; of an advocacy
of animals&#8217; rights must be faced and swept
away. The fear of this absurd charge deprives the
cause of humanity of many workers who would otherwise
lend their aid, and accounts in part for the unduly
diffident and apologetic tone which is too often adopted
by humanitarians. We must meet this ridicule, and
retort it without hesitation on those to whom it properly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
pertains. The laugh must be turned against the
true &#8220;cranks&#8221; and &#8220;crotchet-mongers&#8221;&mdash;the noodles
who can give no wiser reason for the infliction of suffering
on animals than that it is &#8220;better for the animals
themselves&#8221;&mdash;the flesh-eaters who labour under the
pious belief that animals were &#8220;sent&#8221; to us as food&mdash;the
silly women who imagine that the corpse of a bird is a
becoming article of head-gear&mdash;the half-witted sportsmen
who vow that the vigour of the English race is
dependent on the practice of fox-hunting&mdash;and the
half-enlightened scientists who are unaware that vivisection
has moral and spiritual, no less than physical,
consequences. That many of our arguments are mere
superficial sword-play, and do not touch the profound
emotional sympathies on which the cause of humanity
rests, is a fact which does not lessen their controversial
significance. For this is a case where those who take
the sword shall perish by the sword; and the clever
men-of-the-world who twit consistent humanitarians
with sentimentality may perhaps discover that they
themselves&mdash;fixed as they are in an ambiguous and
utterly untenable position&mdash;are the sickliest sentimentalists
of all.</p>

<p>II. Legislation, where the protection of harmless
animals is concerned, is the fit supplement and sequel
to education, and the objections urged against it are
for the most part unreasonable. It must inevitably
fail in its purpose, say some; for how can the mere
passing of a penal statute prevent the innumerable
unwitnessed acts of cruelty and oppression which
make up the great total of animal suffering? But the
purpose of legislation is not merely thus preventive.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
Legislation is the record, the register, of the moral
sense of the community; it follows, not precedes, the
development of that moral sense, but nevertheless in
its turn reacts on it, strengthens it, and secures it
against the danger of retrocession. It is well that
society should proclaim, formally and decisively, its
abhorrence of certain practices; and I do not think
it can be doubted, by those who have studied the
history of the movement, that the general treatment
of domestic animals in this country, bad as it still is,
would be infinitely worse at this day but for the legislation
that dates from the passing of &#8220;Martin&#8217;s Act&#8221;
in 1822.</p>

<p>The further argument so commonly advanced, that
&#8220;force is no remedy,&#8221; and that it is better to trust to
the good feeling of mankind than to impose a legal
restriction, is an amiable criticism which might doubtless
be applied with great effect to a large majority of
our existing penal enactments, but it is not very applicable
to the case under discussion. For if force is
ever allowable, surely it is so when it is applied for a
strictly <i>defensive</i> purpose, such as to safeguard the
weak and helpless from violence. The protection of
animals by statute marks but another step onward in
that course of humanitarian legislation which, among
numerous triumphs, has abolished slavery and passed
the Factory Acts&mdash;always in the teeth of this same
time-honoured objection that &#8220;force is no remedy.&#8221;
Equally fatuous is the assertion that the administrators
of the law cannot be trusted to adjudicate between
master and &#8220;beast.&#8221; It was long ago stated by Lord
Erskine that &#8220;to distinguish the severest discipline,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
for enforcing activity and commanding obedience in
such dependents, from brutal ferocity and cruelty,
never yet puzzled a judge or jury&mdash;never, at least, in
my long experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such arguments against the legal protection of
animals were admirably refuted by John Stuart
Mill:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The reason for legal intervention in favour of children
apply not less strongly to the case of those unfortunate
slaves and victims of the most brutal part of mankind, the
lower animals. It is by the grossest misunderstanding of
the principles of Liberty that the infliction of exemplary
punishment on ruffianism practised towards these defenceless
beings has been treated as a meddling by Government
with things beyond its province&mdash;an interference with domestic
life. The domestic life of domestic tyrants is one of
the things which it is most imperative on the Law to interfere
with. And it is to be regretted that metaphysical
scruples respecting the nature and source of the authority of
governments should induce many warm supporters of laws
against cruelty to the lower animals to seek for justification
of such laws in the incidental consequences of the indulgence
of ferocious habits to the interest of human beings,
rather than in the intrinsic merits of the thing itself. What
it would be the duty of a human being, possessed of the requisite
physical strength, to prevent by force, if attempted
in his presence, it cannot be less incumbent on society
generally to repress. The existing laws of England are
chiefly defective in the trifling&mdash;often almost nominal&mdash;maximum
to which the penalty, even in the worst cases,
is limited.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>Only with the gradual progress of an enlightened
sense of equality shall we remedy these wrongs; and
the object of our crusade should be not so much
to convert opponents (who, by the very disabilities
and limitations of their faculties, can never be
really converted,) as to set the confused problem
in a clear light, and at least discriminate unmistakably
between our enemies and our allies. In all
social controversies the issues are greatly obscured
by the babel of names and phrases and cross arguments
that are bandied to and fro; so that many
persons, who by natural sympathy and inclination
are the friends of reform, are found to be ranked
among its foes; while not a few of its foes, in
similar unconsciousness, have strayed into the opposite
camp. To state the issues distinctly, and so attract
and consolidate a genuine body of support, is, perhaps,
at the present time, the best service that humanitarians
can render to the movement they wish to
promote.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would state emphatically that this
essay is not an appeal <i>ad misericordiam</i> to those who
themselves practise, or who condone in others, the
deeds against which a protest is here raised. It is not
a plea for &#8220;mercy&#8221; (save the mark!) to the &#8220;brute-beasts&#8221;
whose sole criminality consists in not belonging
to the noble family of <i>homo sapiens</i>. It is addressed
rather to those who see and feel that, as has
been well said, &#8220;the great advancement of the world,
throughout all ages, is to be measured by the increase
of humanity and the decrease of cruelty&#8221;&mdash;that man,
to be truly man, must cease to abnegate his common<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
fellowship with all living nature&mdash;and that the coming
realization of human rights will inevitably bring after
it the tardier but not less certain realization of the
rights of the lower races.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">APPENDIX</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="ph2">THE TERM &#8220;RIGHTS&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was argued by Mr. D. G. Ritchie, in his book on &#8220;Natural
Rights,&#8221; that though &#8220;we may be said to have duties of
<i>kindness towards</i> the animals,&#8221; it is &#8220;incorrect to represent
these as strictly <i>duties towards</i> the animals themselves, as if
they had rights against us.&#8221; (The italics are Mr. Ritchie&#8217;s.)
I take this to mean that, in man&#8217;s &#8220;duty of kindness,&#8221; it
is the &#8220;kindness&#8221; only that has reference to animals, the
&#8220;duty&#8221; being altogether the private affair of the man. The
kindness is, so to speak, the water, and the duty is the
tap; and the convenience of this arrangement is that the man
can shut off the kindness whenever it suits him to do so; as,
for example, it suited Mr. Ritchie in regard to the question
of vivisection.</p>

<p>It is strange that ethical authorities should thus hold, as
Catholic theologians do, that we owe no direct duties to
animals, and that animals not being &#8220;persons&#8221; have, strictly
speaking, no rights. Indeed, so entertaining did the very
idea of the &#8220;personality&#8221; of animals appear to Mr. Ritchie
that he waxed humorous in his desire to know whether a
sponge is a &#8220;person&#8221; or &#8220;several persons,&#8221; and whether
the parasites on a dog are to be respected as &#8220;persons,&#8221; and
so forth.</p>

<p>On the other side, the humanitarian contention is quite
clear&mdash;that there is no difference <i>in kind</i> between man and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
the other animals, nor any warrant in science or ethics for
drawing between them, as between &#8220;persons&#8221; and &#8220;things,&#8221;
an absolute line of demarcation. Compelled to admit that
the difference is only one of degree, Mr. Ritchie sought to
evade the significance of this fact by arguing that it does
not follow that, if men have rights, animals also have rights
&#8220;in the same sense of the term.&#8221; I maintain that it <i>does</i> so
follow. If by the recognition of rights we mean that man,
as a sentient and intelligent being, should be exempt from
all avoidable suffering, it follows that other beings who are
also sentient and intelligent, though in a lower degree,
should have, in a lower degree, the same exemption. This
principle, if pressed to its extreme logical conclusion, will of
course lead, like all other principles, to what Mr. Ritchie
called &#8220;difficult questions of casuistry,&#8221; and will open a door
for small jokes about the personality of parasites and sponges.</p>

<p>Then, again, it is too often overlooked that the rights
claimed for animals, as for men, are not absolute but conditional
(&#8220;this restricted freedom&#8221; is Herbert Spencer&#8217;s
expression), and that a recognition of the rights of other
beings is not incompatible with an equal assertion of one&#8217;s
own. Self-defence is the first and most obvious right of
everyone. If, for instance, we hold that a tiger has a right
to be spared any unnecessary torture, are we compelled on
that account to allow him to eat us if he comes out of his
cage? And how would our shooting the tiger, under those
untoward circumstances, prove that the tiger is not a
&#8220;person,&#8221; inasmuch as murderers and <i>human</i> tigers, are
similarly treated under similar conditions? This &#8220;tiger&#8221;
argument, to which Professor Ritchie was much addicted,
is really very small game.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE NEO-CARTESIANS<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attempts</span> are still made, from time to time, to revive the
old Cartesian doctrine that animals do not feel pain. Thus
Mr. E. Kay Robinson, in a book entitled &#8220;The Religion of
Nature&#8221; (1906) has sought to bring peace and comfort to
the minds of his readers, and to reconcile the seeming cruelties
of Nature with the existence of a merciful God, by
proving that the non-human races, unlike mankind, have no
consciousness of suffering, even when they exhibit all the
symptoms of pain and show a dread of its recurrence. This
is nothing but the ancient doctrine of Descartes in a new
garb, and is itself the outcome of the old anthropocentric
view of the world.</p>

<p>On the practical results that would follow the general
acceptance of Mr. Robinson&#8217;s theories it is hardly worth
while to speculate. He himself is at pains to suggest that
while the Cartesian doctrine undoubtedly led to cruelty in
the past, the modern Robinsonian version of it would have
the opposite effect. I greatly doubt it. For to whatever extent
it is true that animals are unconscious of pain, to the
same extent it must be true that there is no &#8220;cruelty&#8221; (in
the true sense of the term) in &#8220;paining&#8221; them. An enlightened
man, no doubt, will avoid any tyrannical interference
with the lives of other beings, whether they are conscious or
not, but the majority of men are not enlightened, nor in any
hurry to become so; we are living, in fact, in an age of very
gross and palpable savagery, out of which nothing can lift
us but the growing sense of kinship. Mr. Robinson&#8217;s book
is one of the latest attempts&mdash;and, in some respects, the
feeblest&mdash;to impair in a very important respect this sense of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
close kinship between the human and the non-human, and
for that reason I regard it as very mischievous in its tendency.
As a fair instance of Mr. Robinson&#8217;s logic, let us take his
triumphant citation of the fact that even a human being,
when engaged in some desperate and painful struggle, is often
conscious, for the moment, of neither fear nor pain. From
this Mr. Robinson quietly assumes that animals are <i>always</i>
thus unconscious, because (<i>a</i>) some of their actions and
emotions are so, and (<i>b</i>) &#8220;we have no right to suppose that
one action or emotion of an animal is more conscious than
another.&#8221; But, on the contrary, we have every right to suppose
that consciousness varies in animals, as in men, as may
be gathered from the indifference which two fighting dogs
will show to the blows rained upon them by their owners,
though at a moment of less excitement the same blows would
elicit the most obvious signs of pain.</p>

<p>The <i>crux</i> of the whole problem lies here&mdash;in the meaning
of the gestures by which animals appear to indicate that,
like human beings, they are conscious of their various emotions,
and it is by his chapter on &#8220;Actions of Animals
Explained&#8221; that Mr. Robinson&#8217;s treatise must be judged.
Humanitarians entirely reject his dogmatic assertion (to take
a typical example) that &#8220;a dog&#8217;s exhibition of distress when
separated from its master and mistress is only the working
of the strong instinct of the gregarious, hunting animal,
needing the primary factor of his life, namely, a leader to
follow.&#8221; Not a particle of real proof can be given in support
of such statements, and it is upon foundations of this kind
that the &#8220;Religion of Nature&#8221; is built. And here there
come to mind those trenchant words of Mr. Cunninghame
Graham, which exactly describe the tone and method of
Mr. Robinson&#8217;s argument:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Instinct and reason; the hypothetical difference which good
weak men use as an an&aelig;sthetic, when their conscience pricks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
them for their sins of omission and commission to their four-footed
brethren. But a distinction wholly without a difference,
and a link in the long chain of fraud and force with which we
bind all living things, men, animals, and most of our reasoning
selves, in one crass neutral-tinted slavery.&#8221;</p></div>


<h3>III</h3>

<p class="ph2">MOTOR VERSUS HORSE<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;After</span> many centuries of usefulness,&#8221; so it is said, &#8220;the
horse is about to be retired from active service as an agent in
locomotion.&#8221; Electricity, petrol, and cable tramcars are to
be the chief factors in this change, which will replace horsepower
by the greater energies of mechanical invention, and
will make it possible to ride a hundred miles &#8220;for about
a shilling.&#8221; Looking at the matter as humanitarians we are
heartily pleased at the prospect. To be sure, it is not very
creditable to the good feelings of mankind that, &#8220;after
many centuries of usefulness,&#8221; the horse should be &#8220;retired,&#8221;
not because we are ashamed of the ill-usage he has received,
but because we have discovered a cheaper method of traction;
nor is it pleasant to reflect on the countless myriads of undeserved
blows and curses that have descended on our faithful
friend and helper during the period of his service. But
letting that pass, as one of the many blots with which the
pages of history are disfigured, we rejoice to think that the
wretched system of horse-traction is perhaps drawing to a
close, and we trust that the present century will see it legally
prohibited in England, as dog-traction has already been.</p>

<p>No doubt we shall hear a lot of sentimental talk about
the picturesque beauty of the horse, the ugliness of machinery,
and so forth; but we shall know what to reply to such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
&#8220;&aelig;sthetic&#8221; arguments, with the experience before us (or, let
us hope, <i>behind</i> us) of the hackney-cab, the tramcar, and the
tradesman&#8217;s cart and wagon. The usage of the horse, in our
so-called civilization, has reached a pitch of sordid deformity
which, even if regarded solely from the point of view of the
artist, makes it impossible to advance any valid argument
against the motor-car. However unromantic such mechanical
conveyance may be, it will at least save us from the
unseemly sights that have outraged every sense of beauty,
decency and humaneness. The motor will not be recklessly
overloaded; it will not be cursed, and thrashed, and wrenched
out of its natural shape by way of an outlet for the savage
temper of its driver; for curiously enough, the lifeless machine
will be treated with far more respect, and in a far more
rational spirit, than the living animal, and the conductor
who should ill-use a car, as horses are now ill-used, would
be promptly conveyed to the nearest police-cell or lunatic-asylum.</p>

<p>But what, it may be asked, is to become of the horse himself,
in the new age of machinery? Is &#8220;retirement,&#8221; in his
case, to be the same thing as extinction? We do not know;
but we know this&mdash;that, in the case of our &#8220;beasts of burden,&#8221;
merciful extinction is a preferable fate to what is humorously
called &#8220;preservation.&#8221; Centuries hence, perhaps, some
learned antiquarian will reconstruct, from such anatomical
data as may be available, the gaunt, misshapen, pitiable
figure of the London cab-horse, and a more humane and
enlightened posterity will shudder at the sight of what we
still regard as a legitimate &#8220;agent in locomotion.&#8221;</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="ph2">ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> fifty or sixty years ago the poet, James Thomson
(&#8220;B.V.&#8221;), wrote as follows in his journal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;It being a very wet Sunday, I had to keep in, and paced
much, prisoner-like, to and fro my room. This reminded me of
the wild beasts at Regent&#8217;s Park, and especially of the great
wild birds, the vultures and eagles. How they must suffer! How
long will it be ere the thought of such agonies becomes intolerable
to the public conscience, and wild creatures be left at
liberty when they need not be killed. Three or four centuries,
perhaps.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>This gloomy prognostication hardly seems likely to be fulfilled,
for there has lately been a great awakening of the
conscience, if not of the general public, at least of the
humaner section of it, and much improvement in the condition
of the wild animals in the &#8220;Zoo&#8221; has now been effected.
Ever since its establishment in 1891 the Humanitarian
League has been drawing attention to the cruelty of cellular
imprisonment for animals as for men, and it is therefore with
legitimate satisfaction that humanitarians note the introduction
of a reform which they were the first to advocate. Here,
for example, is an extract from a pamphlet which I wrote for
the League in 1895, under the title of &#8220;A Zoophilist at the
Zoo&#8221;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Christianos ad leones&#8217; was the cry of the heathen persecutors
in ages long past, when the Christian martyrs were flung to the
lions in the Roman amphitheatre. Time has now had his revenges;
but we do not know that the new version of &#8216;Christianos
ad leones,&#8217; as daily exemplified in the stream of visitors to the
lion-houses at the Zoo, is altogether edifying. Indeed, it has
sometimes occurred to us, when musing on that strange medley
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>of thoughtless sight-seers, who derive an unaccountable pleasure
from staring at the wretched life-prisoners in our great animal
convict-station, that the infra-human is not always confined to
the inner side of the bars, and that there was some force in
Thoreau&#8217;s epigram that God made man &#8216;a little lower than the
<i>animals</i>.&#8217; Well, we must hope for better things in the future.
Less than a century ago it was the fashion to cage pauper
lunatics where passers-by could see them; and benevolent
nurses, when inclined to give a treat to the children in their
charge, would pleasantly take them to have a peep at the
frenzied ravings of the maniacs. We marvel now to hear of such
inhumanity, but it may be that a future generation will equally
marvel to hear that the sight of caged animals&mdash;those martyrs
of Christian civilization&mdash;could give any satisfaction to the
children, and the grown-up children to whom a &#8220;Zoo&#8221; is a
Paradise.</p>

<p>&#8220;It all depends on how we look at these things. At present
menageries are simply part of the whole system which regards the
lower animals as mere goods and chattels, created for the use
and amusement of mankind, without any definite claim, in
return, to a free and healthy existence. The animals are no
more than subjects for the museum or menagerie, the laboratory
or dissecting-room. Does a rare bird alight on our shores? Our
object is to knock it down first, and, as the taxidermists say,
&#8216;set it up&#8217; afterwards; or, if it still lives, to confine it in a cage
or aviary. The London Gardens are doubtless a great deal better
than many other menageries; but our whole method of treating
animals is stupid and barbarous. We want a more humane and
intelligent appreciation of animal life, and that sense of <i>kinship</i>
which would make us desirous of seeing our rudimentary brethren
under happier and more natural conditions.</p>

<p>And, after all, we have ourselves paid the penalty for our lack
of humanity, by the loss of humour that accompanied it; for the
bathos of the notices that used to meet us at every turn in the
Gardens was very depressing to those who were alive enough
to feel it. The Bengal Tigers&#8217; den labelled, &#8216;Beware of Pickpockets&#8217;!
The Eagles&#8217; Aviaries labelled, &#8216;To the Refreshment
Rooms&#8217;! Were ever such incongruous ideas set in such ludicrous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
proximity? There, disconsolate in durance vile, sat the
fabled Bird of Jove, who bore off Ganymede to be the god&#8217;s
cup-bearer, while, within a few yards, the <i>modern</i> Ganymede
was serving out coffees and lemon-squashes, and enjoying
(though perhaps he knew it not) the most complete vengeance
on the great Raptor who enslaved him.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The most powerful indictment of the Zoological Gardens, as
they were, was the series of articles contributed by Mr.
Edmund Selous to the <i>Saturday Review</i> in 1901, and afterwards
reprinted as a pamphlet by the Humanitarian League,
under the title &#8220;The Old Zoo and the New,&#8221; a picture of what
the Zoo actually was, as contrasted with what it might become.
It was the publication of this trenchant criticism, synchronizing
as it did with a movement for reform within the Zoological
Society itself, that brought about the present improved
state of public opinion as to the management of the Gardens,
and caused the <i>Daily Mail</i>, that enterprising journal which
is ready to exploit even humanitarian ideas when they seem
likely to be popular, to publish a number of caustic articles
on &#8220;The Tortured Animals at the Zoo.&#8221;</p>

<p>From America comes the same complaint, as in the following
passage taken from an article in <i>Our Animal Friends</i>
(New York):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;It is indeed high time that the conditions of animals in
menageries and zoological establishments should be made a
subject of very practical concern. In many cases their condition
is pitiable. Few things are more distressing to observe than the
restive motions of the larger cats, such as lions, tigers, and
leopards, or of smaller animals like wolves and foxes, pacing
back and forth in their small dens, as if suffering an agony of
restlessness, as indeed they often must be. No animal ought to
be kept in any such condition, and the time may come&mdash;we
think it has already come&mdash;when this form of cruelty may be
abolished by the strong hand of law, where it cannot be terminated
by the milder methods of persuasion.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3>V</h3>

<p class="ph2">SCIENTIST AND SACERDOTALIST<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> do our up-to-date scientists think (if they think at all)
of the justification of vivisection put forward by Monsignor
John S. Vaughan, a sacerdotalist of the medieval school? To
a watchful observer few things could have been more entertaining
than the spectacle of an old-world Catholic, a belated
casuist of (say) thirteenth century temperament, coming forward
in the <i>Saturday Review</i> (new style) to justify, from a
moral standpoint, the doings of the modern vivisector, and
basing his argument on the immemorial &#8220;proposition&#8221; that
&#8220;beasts exist for the use and benefit of man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, there are undoubtedly numbers of persons living in
this twentieth century who still hold the belief that the animals
were created for man&#8217;s pleasure, and it may be that, in appealing
to that ancient superstition, Mgr. Vaughan was using
the most popular weapon in the pro-vivisectionist armoury.
But whatever the &#8220;man in the street&#8221; may think on this subject,
the evolutionist and man of science, at any rate, is <i>not</i> able
to take refuge in the plea that man is the centre of the universe,
and that all other beings were created for mankind; for if
there is one thing above others that Darwin&#8217;s followers have
scouted, it is this old anthropocentric notion which forms the
Monsignor&#8217;s &#8220;proposition.&#8221; The animals, according to the
scientific view, were not designed for man&#8217;s benefit, nor is
there any impassable gulf between human and non-human&mdash;on
the contrary, man was evolved from among the animals, and
is in very truth an animal himself. This is the creed, beyond
denial or evasion, of the Darwinian scientists, whose torture
of their rudimentary brethren the sacerdotalist is so eager to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
condone. Monsignor Vaughan is defending vivisection by an
assumption which the vivisectors themselves must hold to be
unscientific and obsolete. The sufficient answer to the anthropocentric
fallacy of the theologian is found in Mr. Howard
Moore&#8217;s laconic remark: &#8220;But Darwin has lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>But vivisection has got to be defended somehow, on moral,
as well as medical, grounds; and to do Monsignor Vaughan
justice the ground he alleges is the only one that can afford,
or could once have afforded, any semblance of logical foot-hold.
&#8220;Beasts exist for the use and benefit of man.&#8221; In that
unquestioned belief lay the justification&mdash;the supposed justification&mdash;of
the horrible tortures inflicted on animals in the
medicinal and magical quackery of the middle ages, when,
as Dr. Berdoe has pointed out, &#8220;the nastier the medicament
the more was expected of it.&#8221; Animals were regarded alike
by the religion, and the science, and the common usage of
the times, as mere <i>things</i>, providentially designed to be the
instruments of man&#8217;s welfare, at the cost of whatever suffering
to themselves. What, therefore, if they were carved, and
tortured, and vivisected to provide mankind with the filthy
nostrums prescribed as the remedies for disease? An anthropocentric
philosophy could explain and justify it all. And
so it might do at the present time, but for the fact that the
anthropocentric philosophy&mdash;as a philosophy&mdash;has itself
ceased to exist.</p>

<p>Indeed, the point of the complaint against the scientists is
precisely this&mdash;that the practice of vivisection, though perhaps
logically justifiable on the absurd old belief that animals
have no <i>raison d&#8217;&ecirc;tre</i> except to minister to man&#8217;s convenience,
is wholly unjustifiable in the light of evolutionary science,
which has demonstrated beyond question the kinship of all
sentient life. That the scientist, in order to rake together a
moral defence for his doings, should condescend to take shelter
even under the medieval reasoning of the sacerdotalist, is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
proof that his position is hopelessly inconsistent and unsound;
for having got rid of the old anthropocentric fallacy in the
realm of science, he actually avails himself of the same
fallacy in the realm of ethics. This, of course, is less surprising
when we remember that one and the same person
may be, and often is, as reactionary in one department of
thought as he is progressive in another, and that the modern
man of science is not infrequently a medievalist in morals.
The present writer well remembers the incident which first
shook his faith in the infallibility of &#8220;science.&#8221; He had
adopted a vegetarian diet, and a distinguished scientist with
whom he happened to be on friendly terms expressed a wish
to &#8220;speak to him&#8221; on the subject. The writer felt that a
critical moment had arrived, and awaited the scientific pronouncement
with respectful anxiety. When it came&mdash;spoken
with evident earnestness&mdash;it was this: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think the
animals were <i>sent</i> us as food?&#8221;</p>

<p>So we see the scientist and the sacerdotalist, forgetting
their radical differences, patching up a superficial alliance
with the pious object of perpetuating the experimental torture
of the laboratory. Henceforward let none say that Darwinian
and Catholic are not in agreement. <i>Laborare est orare</i> was
the old saying; and now surely it should be expanded by
Monsignor Vaughan and his Catholic fellow-vivisectionists
into <i>laboratorium est oratorium</i>&mdash;the house of torture is the
house of prayer. If it is not exactly &#8220;mercy and truth&#8221; that
are met together, &#8220;righteousness and peace&#8221; that have
kissed each other, still it is a beautiful and touching scene
of reconciliation&mdash;this meeting of scientist and sacerdotalist
over the torture-trough of the helpless animal. They might
exclaim in the words of Tennyson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;There above the little grave,</div>
<div class="verse">O there above the little grave,</div>
<div class="indent">We kissed again with tears.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>It seems to us as humanitarians, that, as far as Monsignor
Vaughan and the Catholic vivisectionist school is concerned
(it is otherwise with the scientists), it is pure waste of time to
argue with them, there being a fundamental difference of
opinion as to data and principles. The sole reason for discussion
is to insure that the humanitarian view of the question
be rightly placed before the public, and this can best be
done by stating it clearly in contradistinction to the anthropocentric
dogma. We do <i>not</i> admit the assumption that
&#8220;beasts exist for the use and benefit of man.&#8221; We view the
matter in a wholly different aspect. We find ourselves born
into an age which has been evolved in a gradual progress
from savagery to civilization, with old-world wrongs around
us, the worst of which are being slowly redeemed, century
after century, by a growing spirit of brotherhood. We have
never pretended that these wrongs, woven as they are into
the fabric of Society, can be immediately and simultaneously
righted, nor do we admit, in the case of the lower animals
any more than in the case of men, that the necessity of inflicting
<i>some</i> pain confers the right to inflict <i>any</i> pain. We
insist on the undeniable tendency from barbarism to humaneness,
which has already at many points bridged the gulf
between man and man, and will also bridge the gulf between
man and his lower fellow-creatures. Science has exploded
the idea that there is any difference in kind, and not in
degree only, between the human and the non-human animal;
and sympathy, guided by reason, is making it more and more
impossible that we should for ever treat as mere automata
fellow-beings to whom we are, in fact, very closely akin.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE CONFESSIONS OF A PHYSICIAN<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Confessions</span> of a Physician,&#8221; by V. Veresaeff, is a
Russian work, first published in 1901, the writer of which
exposes with the utmost frankness the secrets of the medical
profession&mdash;the doubts, difficulties, dangers, scruples, failures,
and even homicides, that fall to the lot of the practitioner.
It is not that Veresaeff is disloyal to his colleagues; but his
judgment is drawn in two opposite directions by his sense
of duty to Science on the one side, and to Morality on the
other, and is exercised by the problem of how to reconcile
the &#8220;necessities,&#8221; as he conceives them, of medical research
with the &#8220;rights,&#8221; as he cannot but admit them to be, of its
human and non-human victims. Hence, though Veresaeff
is himself only in part a humanitarian, his book has considerable
interest for humanitarian readers.</p>

<p>In a dissertation on the English anti-vivisection movement,
from which the Russian movement originated, Veresaeff,
while not stifling his misgivings, falls back on the assertion
that vivisection is necessary, because it is impossible without
it to know the living organism. He is very contemptuous of
the &#8220;clergymen, society ladies, statesmen, persons entirely
unassociated with science,&#8221; who seek to refute the scientists;
but then, veering to the moral side of the question, he makes
the following reference to this book on &#8220;Animals&#8217; Rights&#8221;:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;However, we must give them their due; for not all the anti-vivisectionists
base their opinions upon such crude and ignorant
tenets. A number of them seek to base the whole question upon
foundations of pure principle; thus, for instance, the author of
&#8216;Animals&#8217; Rights, Considered in relation to Social Progress,&#8217;
says: &#8216;Let us assume that the progress of surgical science is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>assisted by the experiments of the vivisector. What then?
Before rushing to the conclusion that vivisection is justifiable on
that account, a wise man will take into full consideration the
other&mdash;the moral side of the question&mdash;the hideous injustice of
torturing an innocent animal.&#8217; This is the only possible and
fitting position for the anti-vivisectionist to take up; whether
science can dispense with vivisection or not, does not concern
him; animals are made to suffer, and that settles everything.
The question is plainly put, and there can be no room for any
equivocation. I repeat, we ought not to ridicule the pretensions
of the anti-vivisectionists&mdash;the sufferings of animals are truly
horrible&mdash;and sympathy with them is not sentimentality; but we
must bear in mind that there is no &#8216;way round,&#8217; where the
building up of scientific medicine&mdash;its goal&mdash;the healing of mankind&mdash;is
at stake.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p></div>

<p>While welcoming this statement, I must point out that in
the passage of &#8220;Animals&#8217; Rights&#8221; (p. 71) to which Dr.
Veresaeff refers, I did not for a moment <i>admit</i> that vivisection
is necessary to surgical science; I merely <i>assumed</i> it for
purposes of argument, and I added the important qualifying
words which are omitted in the Russian quotation: &#8220;A large
assumption certainly, controverted as it is by some most
weighty medical testimony.&#8221; It is necessary to point this out,
because we humanitarians do not share Dr. Veresaeff&#8217;s perplexity,
swayed as he is between the demands of a vivisecting
science and the protests of a suffering humanity; on the contrary,
we are convinced that the painful contradiction between
conflicting duties, by which his mind is troubled, is a phantom
of his own creation. No doubt if he assumes that one particular
science, that of medicine, must pursue its course
regardless of any other science, such as that of morals, he
will find himself confronted by problems and contradictions
innumerable, to which no direct answer can be given; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
that very assumption is one which no clear-headed thinker
will grant. No single science can make true progress at the
expense of another science; and when such conflicts arise
they are a sign that there is something wrong, and that it is
time to pause and to reflect. Medical problems, like all
others, can only be solved in the solution of the social question
as a whole, and there is no royal road to the achievement
of medical aspirations.</p>

<p class="ph2">ANTIPATHY OR SYMPATHY?<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is to be regretted that so distinguished a writer as Mr.
G. K. Chesterton should have given countenance to the idea
that an assertion of the rights of animals implies a denial of
the rights of man. &#8220;I use the word humanitarian,&#8221; he says
(in his book &#8220;Orthodoxy,&#8221;) &#8220;in the ordinary sense, as meaning
one who upholds the claims of all creatures against those
of humanity.&#8221; This strange blunder of supposing that we
humanitarians regard the interests of humans and sub-humans
as antagonistic to each other seems to arise from a misunderstanding
of our statement that, in the spread of humane
feelings, there is a <i>gradual</i>, not immediate, recognition of
kinship, embracing first the family, then the fellow citizen,
then the slave, and then the non-human race&mdash;a progressive
sense of morality which is thus ridiculed by Mr. Chesterton:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I think it wrong to sit on a man. Soon, I shall think it wrong
to sit on a horse. Eventually (I suppose,) I shall think it wrong
to sit on a chair. That is the drive of the argument.... A perpetual
tendency, to touch fewer and fewer things might, one
feels, be a mere brute unconscious tendency, like that of a species
to produce fewer and fewer children.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>Mr. Chesterton, it will be seen, supposes that the trend of
humanitarian thought is merely &#8220;to touch fewer and fewer
things&#8221;&mdash;to &#8220;touch,&#8221; that is, with the whip, the hob-nailed
boot, the hunting-knife, the scalpel, or the pole-axe. He
wholly fails to see that what we really desire is to &#8220;touch&#8221;
not fewer and fewer things, but more and more&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, to get
into touch with them by virtue of that sympathetic intelligence
which shows us that they are akin to ourselves. Why,
ultimately, do we object to such practices as vivisection,
blood-sport, and the butchery of animals for food? Because
of the cruelty involved in them, no doubt; but also, and
even more, because of the hideous narrowing of our own
human sympathies and human pleasures which these savage
customs involve.</p>

<p>Let Mr. Chesterton imagine the existence of an ogreish
race of men so powerful that wherever one of them appeared,
all ordinary mortals would be fain to run at full speed into
holes and corners to escape him. Would these tyrants find
it to be a diminution, and not rather a vast increase, of their
enjoyment, if they learnt gradually &#8220;to touch fewer and fewer
things&#8221; in the ogreish sense, while they touched more and
more in the sense of brotherhood and friendship? Precisely
the same in kind, though not, of course, in degree, is the
relation, as apprehended by humanitarians, of man towards
the lower animals.</p>

<p>Equally erroneous is Mr. Chesterton&#8217;s assumption that
mankind is, in some special and exclusive sense, a &#8220;society,&#8221;
different in kind, and not in degree only, from the lower races.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Mankind is not a tribe of animals to which we owe compassion.
Mankind is a club to which we owe our subscription. Pity,
the vague sentiment of the <i>sunt lacrym&aelig; rerum</i>, is due indisputably
to everything that lives. And as regards this, the
difference between our pity for suffering men and our pity for
suffering animals is very possibly only a question of degree. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
the difference between our moral relation to men and to animals
is not a difference of degree in the least. It is a difference of
kind. What we owe to a human being we owe to a fellow-member
of a fixed, responsible, and reciprocal society.... This is
the basic error upon which all Mr. Salt&#8217;s school goes wrong.
They will not see that when we talk of human superiority we do
not mean superiority in a degree on an inclined plane; we mean
the existence of a certain definite society, different from everything
else, and founded not on the sorrows of all living, but on
the rights of men. Cruelty to man and cruelty to animals are
two quite detestable, but quite different, sins.... The man who
breaks a cat&#8217;s back breaks a cat&#8217;s back. The man who breaks
a man&#8217;s back breaks an implied treaty. The tyrant to animals
is a tyrant. The tyrant to men is a traitor. Nay, he is a rebel,
for man is royal.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p></div>

<p>Mankind, says Mr. Chesterton, is a society. But so are
bees and beavers. There are innumerable societies, and it is
impossible to prove that human society is more organic or
more conclusive than the rest. Our sense of kinship is continually
widening, and there never has been, nor is, any
finality in the social bond of which Mr. Chesterton speaks.
It would have surprised the Greek or Roman of old to be
informed that he was a member of the same society with the
barbarian or the slave. It would hardly be admitted by the
white American of to-day that he and the African negro are
own brethren. That, presumably, is because their sympathies
are not yet developed enough to enable them to see even
the fact of human kinship; but what if Mr. Chesterton&#8217;s
sympathies are not developed enough to enable <i>him</i> to see
what many less subtle intellects have already seen&mdash;that
beyond this &#8220;human&#8221; society there is the still larger society
of the higher sentient existence.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who breaks a cat&#8217;s back breaks a cat&#8217;s back.&#8221;
This terse saying contains the root of all cruelty to animals,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
the quintessence of all the anthropocentric bigotry which
has caused the immemorial ill-usage of the non-human races
through the length and breadth of the world. &#8220;The man
who breaks a cat&#8217;s back breaks a cat&#8217;s back.&#8221; Yes, and the
scientist who vivisects a dog, vivisects a dog; the sportsman
who breaks up a hare breaks up a hare; the butcher who
bleeds a calf bleeds a calf. That is all. And if one points
out the cruelty, injustice, and folly of vivisection, or sport,
or flesh-eating, appeal is instantly made to the vaunted fact
that man is &#8220;royal&#8221; and the human race &#8220;a society&#8221;!</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p class="ph2">THE ANIMAL QUESTION AND THE SOCIAL
QUESTION<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is, perhaps, not sufficiently recognized by zoophilists how
largely the ill-usage of the lower animals is due to the iniquity
of present social conditions, and how vain it is to expect to
remedy the consequences without attacking the cause. So
long as pecuniary profit and self-interest are accepted as the
guiding principles of trade, it will remain impossible to secure
a right treatment for animals; because it is absurd to suppose
that mankind will agree to exempt the lower races from the
results of an economic tyranny of which men also are the
victims. If the worship of the great god &#8220;Profit&#8221; bears so
hardly on men and women, is it likely that the result of this
pitiless struggle will be less disastrous to the animals, who
by most people are not regarded as fellow-beings at all?</p>

<p>Let us take a few instances. The over-working of horses
is one of the commonest and worst forms of ill-treatment to
which domestic animals are liable, and is justly punishable
by law when &#8220;cruelty&#8221;&mdash;that somewhat vague offence&mdash;can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
be proved. But such proof, except in flagrant cases, is
rendered practically impossible by the fact that, for the sake
of employers&#8217; profits, men and women are daily over-worked
quite as cruelly as horses are. If tramway companies are
permitted to work their men long and shameful hours to
swell the shareholders&#8217; dividends, what can be done for the
horses? And where there is actual ill-usage of horses by
those who have charge of them, it must be remembered that
the men&#8217;s ill-temper is often the result of the harsh conditions
under which they work. Selfishness begets its like, and the
sufferers by a harsh system will in turn treat other sufferers
harshly.</p>

<p>Again, why is it that so many persons are engaged in trades
that involve cruelty to animals? Obviously because the
present conditions of society leave them no choice. One man
must be a slaughterman, another a cattle drover, another a
bird-catcher, because no other occupation happens to be
open to him, and he naturally chooses to ill-treat animals
rather than to starve himself. Economic necessity leaves no
scope for humaneness. Before we fairly condemn the brutal
drover, or sealer, or bird-catcher, we must so reconstitute
society as to ensure to each citizen a decent and humane
livelihood. It is idle to preach humanity to those who themselves
live in ever-present fear of the hunger-wolf.</p>

<p>In like manner &#8220;sport,&#8221; in its baser forms, is maintained
and perpetuated by bad social conditions. It was the
&#8220;hangers on&#8221; of the Royal Buckhounds who made it so
difficult to abolish that disreputable institution; tame stags
must still be worried that local &#8220;trade&#8221; may be encouraged;
and that rich idlers may come into the hunting districts to
spend their wealth. So, too, the blackguardly pastimes of
rabbit-coursing and pigeon-shooting are mainly supported
by the betting and gambling element, which thrives in proportion
as honest work is underpaid. Nor is it to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
wondered that many individuals of all classes should become
gamblers and rogues, when the principle of commercial
enterprise is what it is&mdash;an utterly immoral desire to make
money by the quickest possible method, and without the
slightest consideration for any interests but one&#8217;s own.</p>

<p>In this breakneck competition everything must be done
at high pressure, or the margin of &#8220;profit&#8221; will be lost. It
is horrible, is it not, that the slaughterman should sometimes
skin the sheep alive? But time is money; and the slaughterman
may himself be the victim of some skinflint employer,
and perhaps he is anxious to rise to eminence in his profession
and give his children a real Christian bringing up. Thus,
too, the master-butchers have opposed the abolition of private
slaughter-houses because their &#8220;profits&#8221; would be lessened.
It costs more to have the best and most modern appliances&mdash;so
humanity once more has had to wait.</p>

<p>The moral is that zoophilists, while in no wise relaxing
their efforts for the welfare of the animals, should also range
themselves on the side of social reform. And this suggests
the remark that the sub-title of this book is not devoid of
significance, for it is when they are &#8220;considered in relation
to social progress&#8221; that the rights of animals are most likely
to be understood.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> An admirable definition of Rights is given by Mr. G. W.
Foote in his contribution to &#8220;The New Charter&#8221;: &#8220;Rights
are of three sorts&mdash;legal, moral, and natural. The legal meaning
of &#8216;Rights&#8217; is undoubtedly the primary one ... and this is the
only <i>definite</i> sense, in which the word can be used.... Moral
Rights are widespread new sentiments, demanding incorporation
into Legal Rights; and Natural Rights are still newer sentiments,
aspiring to recognition as Moral Rights, with a view
to ultimate incorporation as Legal Rights.... They are
respectively, a solid fact, a general demand, and a growing
aspiration.&#8221;</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> This remark implies not the &#8220;disparagement of logic and
of all careful use of language,&#8221; with which Professor D. G.
Ritchie has charged me in his book on &#8220;Natural Rights,&#8221; but
simply that social reformers cannot be debarred from using the
best available terms because no logically exact term is forthcoming.

domestic animals have <i>not</i> been granted rights in English law.
&#8220;Because a work of art, or some ancient monument, is protected
by law from injury, do we speak of the <i>rights</i> of pictures or
stones?&#8221; But the distinction is obvious&mdash;works of art are protected
only as <i>property</i>, domestic animals as <i>sentient beings</i>,
whether owned or unowned.</p>

of rights. For, though he concludes that animals are probably

struggle.&#8221; A similar view is expressed in the &#8220;Study of Animal
Life,&#8221; 1892, by J. Arthur Thomson. &#8220;What we must protest
against,&#8221; he says, in an interesting chapter on &#8220;The Struggle of
Life,&#8221; &#8220;is that one-sided interpretation according to which individualistic

the meaning of the Acts for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
Indeed, if they have ceased to be <i>fer&aelig; natur&aelig;</i> they must be
domestic animals, unless there be some miserable <i>tertium quid</i>
which is neither one nor the other. I am not aware that there
ever has been a definite decision of the High Court upon this

taken up and properly argued, it is possible that a judgment

that special licences can be obtained to dispense with
anaesthetics, or, if an an&aelig;sthetic be administered, to allow
the vivisector to keep the animal alive after the effect of the
an&aelig;sthetic has passed away, in order to watch the results of the

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
